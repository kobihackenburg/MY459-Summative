well, first i want thank you, nick, for having me here and a few of my friends in the college. i just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory. i got to talk with the instructor and four of the students, all of whom are high school students who are doing what you have described as the great opportunity to mix your high school years with college learning and college credits as you move forward.

and i am really pleased to be at a community college that is visionary and effective and trying to serve as a bridge for people who are non-traditional but coming back to add to their stills all the beltway high school students who are taking advantage of the opportunities. and the cooperation between the college and the high school is something i want to see a lot more. this is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us.

and before we get started — because i want to hear from each of you, i want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of — i just want to tell you a little bit about why i'm here today. i think we all know that americans have come back from some tough economic times. and our economy and our country are much better off because american families have basically done whatever it took to make it work. but i think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. and there's something wrong with that. there's something wrong when ceos make 300 times more than the typical worker. there's something wrong when american workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as i just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks. and there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that i saw on i-80 as i was driving here the last two days. and there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills in order to make the best of their own lives. i looked at the figures. the average iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt. and that's i think the ninth-highest debt load in the country. and people are struggling. i met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money.

we're got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track. and i'm running for president because i think that americans and their families need a champion, and i want to be this champion. i want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead. and a lot of people in the last few days have asking why do you want to do this? what motivates you? i thought a lot about it and i guess the short answer is i've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example. she had a really difficult childhood, was mistreated, neglected, but she never gave up. she had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going. my father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family. and then i was thinking, too, about the lessons from my church. you're supposed to give back. you're supposed to do what you can to help others. and that's what i tried to do. and we'll have more time to talk about as that as we go forward.

when i got out of law school, i worked for the children's defense fund. one of the projects there was literally going door to door. this was back in the '70s when kids with disabilities were basically shut out of our schools. and thanks to your great former senator, tom harkin, that's no longer the case. but i was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out. and i was able in arkansas to work to try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. and as first lady, to fight for health care reform and keep fighting until we get health care insurance for kids. then as senator, dealing with the problems that faced new york after 9/11 and trying to help people get what they needed, the victims' families and first responders. it was an incredible honor to do that. then, as secretary of state, standing up for our country.

so when i look at where we are as a country, i'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own god-given potential. but we can't take that for granted. so i want to be the champion who goes to bat for americans in four big areas, four big fights that i think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what i think we should be doing. and they're pretty powerful forces.

we need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. we need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts. we need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment, and we need to protect our country from the threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon.

so i'm here in iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that and to hear from people about what's on your minds, what the challenges that you see are. and i'll work hard to meet as many people. i'll be rolling out ideas and policies about what i think will work. but i want it to be informed by what's actually working and to build on what works going forward, and to stand up for those who have a different vision of our country, a different one than what i grew up with and a different one than i think is best for everybody.
and to meet some of the people who work here, as i did when i was walking through, and as you've just introduced yourself. i am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy.

small business is the backbone of the american economy. here in new hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses. and they employ more than half of the workers, the employees, in the state of new hampshire. so new hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business.

and i come from a small business family. my father had a very small business. he printed drapery fabrics in a print plant. and he did much of the work himself, sometimes with day laborers, sometimes with my mother and my brothers and me, literally, taking the squeegee, pour the paint on the silk screen. you take the squeegee, you go down, then you lift it up and you go to the next and you keep going.

and i saw where now there's a machine that you just bought that's printing on all kinds of material. and i'm thinking back to those years in my father's small print plant. but he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced.

and so from my perspective, i want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in america again. we have stalled out. i was very surprised to see that when i began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as i traveled around the country the last two years, but i didn't know what they were saying.

and it turns out that we're not producing as many small businesses as we used to. and a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business. there are lots of issues and we'll get into some of those, i hope, dave, and the rest of you, as well.

so i want to hear from each of you, because part of what i'm doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do. i want to embed what i propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of american workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again. really, we have to do more for young people, because what we're finding is that with student debt — and new hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country — that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business.

when i was in iowa last week, i met a young man, who — his dream had been to own a bowling center is his hometown. he graduated from college, because he'd worked, like you, during the summers, and he — and he wanted to own that business. he got a chance to do it.

with his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems.

and even now, he's got the business, but he runs it — he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it. here's a young, ambitious guy. and when i think about my dad, it was a lot easier in those days to have an idea, to get what you needed and to go to work.

the other piece of this, as we were walking around and dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country. and many of them, if i'm right, dave, are from europe.

: that's correct.

: and so you think — i mean, europe has high wages. they have high costs. why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us? what's wrong with this picture?

you can — you can see that maybe lower-cost places that are mastering the art of machine production would be competitive, but these are high-value machines. these are very sophisticated machines.

how do we get that into more basic production again so that we can resume our lead in manufacturing, something that i think is essential? a lot of people disagree with me. they say, "oh, you know, those days are over." i don't believe it.

you walk around here, you see these machines from, you know, italy or germany or wherever else they're from. why? why aren't we producing those machines? what do we need to do to jump-start advanced manufacturing once again in our country?

so my bottom line is, we've gone through some tough times, and i think americans have done everything they could think of to do to get through those tough times.

but now it's not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them.

so in order to put together a set of policies for my campaign, i really want to make sure that they are in line with the real lives and the real working experiences of the people that i would love to represent as your president.

so we're going to take on four big fights. you know, we're going to fight to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday, and make the middle class mean something again in this country. we're going to fight to have strong families and strong communities. and of course, it's no accident that i'm at a  whose customer market is between six months and six years. that's — that's right where i am focused these days.

i want to make sure we have a functioning political system. i'm going to fight for that.

i will work with anybody. i've done that. i did it as senator. i will do it again.

but i will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.

and then finally, we always have to be vigilant to protect our country against the threats we know — we can see them — but then the threats we can't see — pandemic diseases, cyber warfare, et cetera.

so i'm excited about this campaign. i'm thrilled to be back in new hampshire. i see some of my friends out there in the audience.

and the first place i ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when i was here campaigning for my husband, in october of 1991. i celebrated my birthday here in — in keene, and i have a lot of wonderful memories.

so with that, dave, i'm going to turn it back to you, and — and we can start hearing from some of the folks.

 i think maybe i'll ask the initial question, and you guys will chime in.

but — but, you know, early childhood is obviously our interest and — our selfish interest, but also, we're fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. and i would like you to elaborate on exactly what you think you might do for child-care in the future if — if you're — you know, if you're elected.

: well, that's a question near and dear to my heart, because i think every society starts with our youngest citizens. and when i got out of law school, i went to work for the children's defense fund. and so my whole adult life, both professionally and my volunteer work, has been around children and families and it is to me the most important commitment we can make.

and now it's not only that we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren, but we now know that the way brains develop, thanks to all the great research that is being done by our scientists, that those early years really are critical to the success that a child will have in school and what that child can learn and then what that child can choose to do, what kind of opportunities will be available.

so i think we have to start in the family. and i've been working on a project to convince parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to read, talk and sing to their babies and that's equally important in any child care setting.

so when you are producing furniture that give kids a chance to be part of a circle, to work on a table, all of that, it's safety and stimulation are the two most important needs that little, tiny babies have. and i think we need a much more broadly based universal pre- kindergarten program so that kids have a chance to get ready for school.

and i really applaud states — and they are not — you know, they're not all the states that you might think of — oklahoma has a universal pre-k program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school.

and i think the child care problem, i was looking at a statistic that it can cost as much as $12,000 a year in new hampshire for quality child care. that's more than the community college costs, as i understand it.

and what are we going to do about that?

how can you expect, you know, most families to afford that kind of cost?

so we've got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school — and i know there's a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that's where you come in.

and you were telling me about a light table and other things that you prepare for settings where little kids are — that's all to stimulate them and give them a chance to develop that brain and learn more so they are better prepared for school.

 yes. thank you.

guys, you want to start off, anybody?

 well, my grandson goes to the head start across the way over there  in there it's filled with whitney brothers products, all down the hallways. they're all on coat lockers. in there are all their — are little tables and chairs. and it made me feel so proud that i worked here, that these people were buying .



 — more for substance abuse, help in our area, there's very limited resources here. and we would like to see something in that respect.

do you have —

: well —  — any further ideas?

: i do, actually. i am — i'm really concerned because, pam, what you just told me, i'm hearing from a lot of different people. there is a hidden epidemic. you know, the drug abuse problem, whether it's pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence. this is a quiet epidemic. and it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city. and at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs. i see senator kelly here and i know how committed she is to trying to get resources.

so we're — we've got a perfect storm. we have an increasing problem that's only beginning to break through the service so that people — you know, i think a lot of people are thinking, well, that's somebody else's problem, it's not my problem and indeed it is all of our problem. and we don't have enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they want to get help, where do you send them?

what kind of opportunities do they have for treatment?

and i am convinced that the mental health issues — because i consider substance abuse part of mental health issues — is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue that people raised with me.

and when i was in iowa last week, i literally heard from one end of the state, from davenport to council bluffs, about this problem and how the state was shutting all their inpatient facilities and there was nowhere for people to be sent.

so we've got to do more. we have treatment in the affordable care act, which is a good thing, which we — and we have at least on paper, what's called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems.

but we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue — i'll just end with this. you probably have read about this small county in southern indiana where there was an epidemic of hiv among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was i guess turned to powder.

so now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted hiv. so this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away. we need a concerted policy, national, state, local, public, private and we need to try to help young people like the mother of your grandson.

 thank you.

 well, the drug issue is not really a no-issue here. i mean, as a kid myself, as the son of a minister, of a preacher, the little town that i grew up in, i was the only kid my age who was not involved in drugs of some sort. the dealer lived across the street, the kids used their drugs in the front lawn of the house next door. i mean — and there was no — really no recourse in upstate new york at that time because this little town of 300,000 acres, one town cop, two local sheriffs, that's a lot of territory to cover.

so it's not really a no issue but it is certainly an ongoing issue.

: you know, that's exactly right. it's not a new issue, but it's taken a new — kind of a new turn, if you will. and i think more young people — maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because i can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don't see that anymore.

and so i think for a lot of young people, especially if it's pills, i think they believe, well, what's wrong with that? i mean, you know it's a prescription pill so that means it must be ok. and they don't know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them. that's a good point. yes.

 bill?

 well, i was in the line with the drugs and things, you made a point that educating the kids at an early age, it might be advantageous to really push the drug issue there at head start, you know, just in a — in a way that they'll understand it, no, it's not a good thing to do, even though your friends might do it. you don't need to do this. you don't have to. there's other ways.

: yes, so starting early.

 start it early.

: and, chris, you hire a lot of people, so you see this, don't you and —

 yes. whitney brothers actually does drug testing. it's a pre-employment drug testing in order to come to work here, so we want a drug-free workplace.

: well, i think that sends a strong message and a lot of employers are either doing that or thinking about that going back to doing it, from what i'm hearing.

is that what you hear from your human resource contacts as well?

 yes. and workmen's comp likes having it, too, because we haven't  machines that people are running and if they're high, running them and obviously there's going to be — someone's going to get hurt.

coordination and everything goes downhill.

: yes.

what are some of the other issues?

jim, like, what's on your mind economically and kind of how you see things for yourself and your family?

 well, thank you. because my kids are all grown and they're in their late 20s so they're — have established themselves and they're doing their thing, so i don't have to worry about them anymore in the way i used to with young kids. but for myself, i'm getting, you know, up in age and looking for — i've worked for small companies all my life. and most of them have just enough money to give you minimal health care, to, you know, retirement. i have very little saved for retirement because of you know, trying to make ends meet with kids and you know, it's  the resources. and the company i just left before i came here a year ago closed their doors because of the economy — they were — they were making super insulated panels for the building industry, which i thought was the way to go.

and so when they closed their doors, i was 27 years working for them, left me with — looking for a new job and thankfully  you know, whitney brothers were looking for my skills to help them with their products and i'm very thankful for being here.

but you know, i look at, you know, hope your ideas on health care and social security and you know, where are those — where are those heading?  probably i'm in my late 50s right now and you know, 10 years from now i'm going to hopefully work less. you know, what's going to — you know, and so, in regards to our company here, , what could be done to help you know, bolster our company here to help us all live a little better life?

: can i ask you, you worked for 27 years.

was there any kind of retirement account, kind of  401(k), anything?

 there was initially; that lasted until the economy went belly up back in 2008. and you know, our company went right down the tubes. so it was, you know, people weren't going to, you know, to spend that extra little bit of money to get a better — a better product.

and you know, the same what happens here. i mean, we're struggling to try to fight with, you know, the chinese and other people who are making similar items to us and are, you know, cutting costs and we're, you know, we look at every penny that we put into the — into our products here and try to you know, get everything out of it we can with the csn machines, with the — with the processes that we use.

so, yes, the company i work for was — i always thought was the way to go.

: well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that american worker productivity has continued to go up. american workers work longer and harder and more productively than the vast majority of workers anywhere in the world.

but it's been very difficult to turn that increased productivity into increased wages and increased benefits. and in some cases, where you have small companies, it's— the margin's just too thin. you know, it's really hard to do that. in some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to. they'd rather stock buybacks than increase the, you know, the wages and salaries of the people who've actually contributed to the productivity and the profits.

so i think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat.

so what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market.

and dave and i were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings. i mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product?

how do you compete with, as you say, somebody doing the same thing in china?

so i think we have to look at this from kind of the top and the middle and try to figure out what's the best way to do it.

on social security, though, you know, there is a lot of loose talk about social security. and i don't know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their social security — they've worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from social security.

you know, the social security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035. so what do we do to make sure it is there and we don't mess with it and we don't, you know, pretend that it's a luxury, because it's not a luxury. it's a necessity for the majority of people who draw from social security.

so i think there will be some big political arguments about social security. and my only question to everybody who thinks we can privatize social security or, you know, undermine it in some way is — and so then what's going to happen to all these people like you, who worked 27 years at this other company?

what's going to happen? it's just wrong.

so part of what we have to do is say, look, let's everybody take a deep breath. let's figure out what works and how we build on what works. and let's not get into arguments, as i say, about ideology and rhetorical, you know, attacks and claims. let's just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, ok, we're going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life. and so i'm 100 percent committed to that.

 that sort of dovetails with what mary's situation — and i don't know your whole circumstances, mary, but you know, mary worked here for a number of years, quit, and then come back. if you could just talk briefly about why you came back and was it a — was it a financial decision or was just because you were bored or what?

 actually, it was a financial situation. as a homeowner there's always overhead that have to be done, those things you have to keep up that you don't really count on when you're not working. so coming back to work and i said i have, why not come back to whitney brothers? it's a place that i know i'm familiar with, i like it and i like the product.  financially.

: did you think, mary, when you retired the first time that you had enough resources to be able to take care of your needs and then something unexpected happened?
thank you so much. i am absolutely delighted to be back here at columbia. i want to thank president bollinger, dean janow, and everyone at the school of international and public affairs. it is a special treat to be here with and on behalf of a great leader of this city and our country, david dinkins. he has made such an indelible impact on new york, and i had the great privilege of working with him as first lady and then, of course, as a new senator.

when i was just starting out as a senator, david's door was always open. he and his wonderful wife joyce were great friends and supporters and good sounding boards about ideas that we wanted to consider to enhance the quality of life and the opportunities for the people of this city. i was pleased to address the dinkins leadership and public policy forum in my first year as a senator, and i so appreciated then as i have in the years since david's generosity with his time and most of all his wisdom. so 14 years later, i'm honored to have this chance, once again, to help celebrate the legacy of one of new york's greatest public servants.

i'm pleased too that you will have the opportunity after my remarks to hear from such a distinguished panel, to go into more detail about some of the issues that we face. i also know that manhattan borough president gale brewer is here, along with other local and community leaders.

because surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever. indeed, it is a time for wisdom.

for yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short.

yet again, the streets of an american city are marred by violence. by shattered glass and shouts of anger and shows of force.

yet again a community is reeling, its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed.

yet again, brave police officers have been attacked in the line of duty.

what we've seen in baltimore should, indeed does, tear at our soul.

and, from ferguson to staten island to baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.

walter scott shot in the back in charleston, south carolina. unarmed. in debt. and terrified of spending more time in jail for child support payments he couldn't afford.

tamir rice shot in a park in cleveland, ohio. unarmed and just 12 years old.

eric garner choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of this city.

and now freddie gray. his spine nearly severed while in police custody.

not only as a mother and a grandmother but as a citizen, a human being, my heart breaks for these young men and their families.

we have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in america.

there is something profoundly wrong when african american men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.

there is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes. and an estimated 1.5 million black men are "missing" from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death.

there is something wrong when more than one out of every three young black men in baltimore can't find a job.

there is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities.

we have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance. and these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again.

we should begin by heeding the pleas of freddie gray's family for peace and unity, echoing the families of michael brown, trayvon martin, and others in the past years.

those who are instigating further violence in baltimore are disrespecting the gray family and the entire community. they are compounding the tragedy of freddie gray's death and setting back the cause of justice. so the violence has to stop.

but more broadly, let's remember that everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone in every community is respected by the law. that is what we have to work towards in baltimore and across our country.

we must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among americans. between police and citizens, yes, but also across society.

restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets. between and among neighbors and even people with whom we disagree politically.

this is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we want to achieve together.

it truly is about how we treat each other and what we value. making it possible for every american to reach his or her god-given potential—regardless of who you are, where you were born, or who you love.

the inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what america can be and should be.

i learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law school—at one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at columbia. one of my earliest jobs for the children's defense fund, which david had mentioned—i was so fortunate to work with marian wright edelman as a young lawyer and then serving on the board of the children's defense fund—was studying the problem then of youth, teenagers, sometimes preteens, incarcerated in adult jails. then, as director of the university of arkansas school of law's legal aid clinic, i advocated on behalf of prison inmates and poor families.

i saw repeatedly how our legal system can be and all too often is stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable.

i saw how families could be and were torn apart by excessive incarceration. i saw the toll on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison.

so, unfortunately, i know these are not new challenges by any means.

in fact they have become even more complex and urgent over time. and today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us.

today there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems. senators as disparate on the political spectrum as cory booker and rand paul and dick durbin and mike lee are reaching across the aisle to find ways to work together. it is rare to see democrats and republicans agree on anything today. but we're beginning to agreeing on this: we need to restore balance to our criminal justice system.

now of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about it—we actually have to work together to get the job done.

we need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses, and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected.

let me touch on two areas in particular where i believe we need to push for more progress.

first, we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.

there's a lot of good work to build on. across the country, there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives. there are police departments already deploying creative and effective strategies, demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. we need to learn from those examples, build on what works.

we can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets.

president obama's task force on policing gives us a good place to start. its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform, from training to technology, guided by more and better data.

we should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects.

that will improve transparency and accountability, it will help protect good people on both sides of the lens. for every tragedy caught on tape, there surely have been many more that remained invisible. not every problem can be or will be prevented with cameras, but this is a commonsense step we should take.

the president has provided the idea of matching funds to state and local governments investing in body cameras. we should go even further and make this the norm everywhere.

and we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions.

as your senator from new york, i supported a greater emphasis on community policing, along with putting more officers on the street to get to know those communities.

david dinkins was an early pioneer of this policy. his leadership helped lay the foundation for dramatic drops in crime in the years that followed.

and today smart policing in communities that builds relationships, partnerships, and trust makes more sense than ever.

and it shouldn't be limited just to officers on the beat. it's an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system. to prosecutors and parole officers. to judges and lawmakers.

we all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities.

we also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country, the inequality that stalks our streets. because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don't talk about what's needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children.

today i saw an article on the front page of usa today that really struck me, written by a journalist who lives in baltimore. and here's what i read three times to make sure i was reading correctly: "at a conference in 2013 at johns hopkins university, vice provost jonathan bagger pointed out that 'only six miles separate the baltimore neighborhoods of roland park and hollins market. but there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy.'"

we have learned in the last few years that life expectancy, which is a measure of the quality of life in communities and countries, manifests the same inequality that we see in so many other parts of our society.

women—white women without high school education—are losing life expectancy. black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country.

this may not grab headlines, although i was glad to see it on the front page of usa today. but it tells us more than i think we can bear about what we are up against.

we need to start understanding how important it is to care for every single child as though that child were our own.

david and i started our conversation this morning talking about our grandchildren; now his are considerably older than mine. but it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other. it was so clearly sharing what is most important to us, as it is to families everywhere in our country.

so i don't want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that. the conversation needs to be much broader. because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.

the second area where we need to chart a new course is how we approach punishment and prison.

it's a stark fact that the united states has less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world's total prison population. the numbers today are much higher than they were 30, 40 years ago, despite the fact that crime is at historic lows.

of the more than 2 million americans incarcerated today, a significant percentage are low-level offenders: people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes, or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts.

keeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime. but it is does a lot to tear apart families and communities.

one in every 28 children now has a parent in prison. think about what that means for those children.

when we talk about one and a half million missing african american men, we're talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers.

they're not there to look after their children or bring home a paycheck. and the consequences are profound.

without the mass incarceration that we currently practice, millions fewer people would be living in poverty.

and it's not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars. of the 600,000 prisoners who reenter society each year, roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment.

and for all this, taxpayers are paying about $80 billion a year to keep so many people in prison.

the price of incarcerating a single inmate is often more than $30,000 per year—and up to $60,000 in some states. that's the salary of a teacher or police officer.

one year in a new jersey state prison costs $44,000—more than the annual tuition at princeton.

if the united states brought our correctional expenditures back in line with where they were several decades ago, we'd save an estimated $28 billion a year. and i believe we would not be less safe. you can pay a lot of police officers and nurses and others with $28 billion to help us deal with the pipeline issues.

it's time to change our approach. it's time to end the era of mass incarceration. we need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.

i don't know all the answers. that's why i'm here—to ask all the smart people in columbia and new york to start thinking this through with me. i know we should work together to pursue together to pursue alternative punishments for low-level offenders. they do have to be in some way registered in the criminal justice system, but we don't want that to be a fast track to long-term criminal activity, we don't want to create another "incarceration generation."

i've been encouraged to see changes that i supported as senator to reduce the unjust federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine crimes finally become law.

and last year, the sentencing commission reduced recommended prison terms for some drug crimes.

president obama and former attorney general holder have led the way with important additional steps. and i am looking forward to our new attorney general, loretta lynch, carrying this work forward.

there are other measures that i and so many others have championed to reform arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences are long overdue.

we also need probation and drug diversion programs to deal swiftly with violations, while allowing low-level offenders who stay clean and stay out of trouble to stay out of prison. i've seen the positive effects of specialized drug courts and juvenile programs work to the betterment of individuals and communities. and please, please, let us put mental health back at the top of our national agenda.

you and i know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers. well, we got half of that equation—but not the other half. our prisons and our jails are now our mental health institutions.

i have to tell you i was somewhat surprised in both iowa and new hampshire to be asked so many questions about mental health. "what are we going to do with people who need help for substance abuse or mental illness?" "what are we going to do when the remaining facilities are being shut down for budget reasons?" "what are we going to do when hospitals don't really get reimbursed for providing the kind of emergency care that is needed for mental health patients?"

it's not just a problem in our cities. there's a quiet epidemic of substance abuse sweeping small-town and rural america as well. we have to do more and finally get serious about treatment.

i'll be talking about all of this in the months to come, offering new solutions to protect and strengthen our families and communities.

i know in a time when we're afflicted by short-termism, we're not looking over the horizon for the investments that we need to make in our fellow citizens, in our children. so i'm well aware that progress will not be easy, despite the emerging bipartisan consensus for certain reforms. and that we will have to overcome deep divisions and try to begin to replenish our depleted reservoirs of trust.

but i am convinced, as the congenital optimist i must be to live my life, that we can rise to this challenge. we can heal our wounds. we can restore balance to our justice system and respect in our communities. and we can make sure that we take actions that are going to make a difference in the lives of those who for too long have been marginalized and forgotten.

let's protect the rights of all our people. let's take on the broader inequities in our society. we can't separate out the unrest we see in the streets from the cycles of poverty and despair that hollow out those neighborhoods.

despite all the progress we've made in this country lifting people up—and it has been extraordinary—too many of our fellow citizens are still left out.

twenty-five years ago, in his inaugural address as mayor, david dinkins warned of leaving "too many lost amidst the wealth and grandeur that surrounds us."

today, his words and the emotion behind them ring truer than ever. you don't have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools. families who work hard but can't afford the rising prices in their neighborhood.

mothers and fathers who fear for their sons' safety when they go off to school—or just to go buy a pack of skittles.

these challenges are all woven together. and they all must be tackled together.

our goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that's measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead...

how many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison...

how many young people can go to college without breaking the bank...

how many new immigrants can start small businesses ...

how many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family.

that's how we should measure prosperity. with all due respect, that is a far better measurement than the size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings.

now even in the most painful times like those we are seeing in baltimore ...

when parents fear for their children...

when smoke fills the skies above our cities...

when police officers are assaulted...

even then—especially then—let's remember the aspirations and values that unite us all: that every person should have the opportunity to succeed. that no one is disposable. that every life matters.

so yes, mayor dinkins. this is a time for wisdom.

a time for honesty about race and justice in america.

and, yes, a time for reform.

david dinkins is a leader we can look to. we know what he stood for. let us take the challenge and example he presents and think about what we must do to make sure that this country we love—this city we live in—are both good and great.

and please join me in saying a prayer for the family of freddie gray, and all the men whose names we know and those we don't who have lost their lives unnecessarily and tragically. and in particular today, include in that prayer the people of baltimore and our beloved country.

thank you all very much.
oh, hello. hi, how are you? well, it's wonderful to be back in nevada and here at rancho. i am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me and all of you about their lives, their stories, and in particular immigration.

i want to acknowledge my friend and congresswoman dina titus. thank you so much for being here. and it is cinco de mayo, so that's especially appropriate day for us to be having this conversation.

i want to begin by thanking everyone at rancho high school for hosting us today. i'm looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. i have a lot of wonderful memories from my time here in nevada. i've gone door to door meeting with families not far from the school.

i've met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. i accompany the registered nurse on 12-hour shift at st. rose dominican hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her and her kids.

and i know how hard hits nevadans work by the great recession. this date in particular suffered some very tough blows. there were a much higher than average home for closure rate for example, a lot of people lost their jobs or their hours or cut dramatically which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living.

we now see that this state is coming back from those top economic times. families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. we also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college. maybe doing some home repairs, maybe putting a little bit aside for retirement. but we're not yet back on our feet.

we have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we've got to do more than just get by. we have to get ahead and stay ahead.

and there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. i think that it's important to recognize that even with all of the hard work and sacrifices so many families made, in many ways, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. and i'm well aware that in las vegas there is nothing worse than a stacked deck.

i want to reshuffle the deck. i want to be a champion for hard-working americans. i want to work across party lines. i want to work with the public and the private sector. i want people to get back to the good old-fashioned american style of problem solving and setting us on back the right course.

now, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. they have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. they have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. my dad was a small businessman and when i say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. my mom, my brothers and i, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the united states. he made a good living for our family and i will forever be grateful for that. because when families are strong, america is strong. and i am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important.

now in this campaign, i think we have to wage and win four big fights. one is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. and that means we've got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. education is the key. but education in the first years of life is essential. because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. so, we've got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own god-given potential.

it's also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that's means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. this is a family issue. it's an economic issue, too.

but it is at heart a family issue at. and if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. the american people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it's the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. that's why we can't wait any longer. we can't wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship.

now this is where i differ with everybody on the republican side. make no mistakes, today not a single republican candidate announced or potential is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. not one.

when they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status. and we should never forget who this debate is about and you're going to meet some of them in just a minute. people who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and wants nothing more than to build a good future for themselves and their children.

we're talking about the young people at this table. they are dreamers in much more than name. they are kids that any parents or grandparent would be proud of. and i don't understand how anyone can look at these young people and think we should break up more families, or turn away more hard workers with talent to help us build the kind of country we all want to see.

so, i will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. i will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. and if congress continues to refuse to act as president, i would do everything possible under the law to go even further.

there are more people, like many parents have dreamers, and others, with deep ties and contributions to our communities, who deserve a chance to stay and i will fight for them.

the law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. but that's just the beginning. there's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. and to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform.

you know, our personal basis, the first time i ever met anyone who was in our country working was when i was about 12 years old, as i recall. and through my church, i was recruited, along with some other girls in our sunday school class to serve as babysitters on saturday for the small children, so the older children could join their parents in the fields because believe it or not when i was growing up in the chicago area, it was farm field as far as the eye could see. and the migrants, immigrant laborer would come up, through the texas up through midwest, up to chicago, then up to michigan. and we were asked to try to help out.

i remember going to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids, while kids at my age were doing really hard work.

and what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day there was a long road from in the camp that went out to a kind of dirt road in the middle of the fields. and the bus that had the workers from the field down it that came back around 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, stopped and let off the parents and the older brothers and sisters and all these little kids started running down the path to see their moms and dads and their big brothers and sisters. and they were scooped up by these really, really tired people.

and i just watched this and i thought, they're just like me and my brothers. you know, when my dad comes home from work, and we go out to see him. after he has come back from his day of doing what he had to do to help support us. i've never gotten that experience to the image out of my mind.

and so, for me, this is about what kind of people we are and what kind of country we have. and i am actually convinced this is in our economic interest. it's in the interest of our values and it's even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation. so, you know, where i stand. and there can be no question about it because i will do everything i can, as president, and during this campaign, to make this case.

i know there are people who disagree with me but i want them to have a conversation with me. because the facts are really clear. you know, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy, both in what they buy and what they pay in texas. in fact in new york, which i know a little bit about because i representative for eight years and i lived there now, our undocumented workers in new york pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in new york. so, i'm ready to have this discussion with anybody, anywhere, any time.

but let me turn to the people who are living this story. i want you to meet them. i want you to hear from them. and i'm going to start with you, asther , if you will introduce yourself, and talk about your own life and what brings you to the table today.

silva: thank you, secretary. my name is asther silva. i am currently a student at the nevada state college pursuing my degree in history with thesis in pre-law. i arrived in united states when i was four years old. and nevada has been my home since i was five. i came here with my mom and dad. i had a younger brother here. he is a united states citizen.

fortunately, our family was scammed when i was very young. and because of that my father was given a deportation order. and so know, he's in order of deportation.

: he was scammed because you hired a lawyer to help you?

silva: yes. well, it wasn't a lawyer. it was  who took advantage of the fact that, you know, there was a lot of different immigration programs in the 1990s and people did not understand the differences. and so because of that, in 2001, my father was given deportation order that was not acted on until 2011. so our family in those 10 years did not know he been had that order deportation.

right now, thankfully, because of prior to your discussion, my dad has state of removal so he will qualify for the different action program once the lawsuit that's really an obstacle right now is moved out of the way. and my mom will who is here, she will be able to apply so that we're not afraid that she will be deported.

: and talk to me a little bit about what you have done in school. how you see your future. the contributions you have already made as a young person and what you would like to do further.

silva: growing up, i was really dedicated to school. my parents, they put a really big emphasis on me succeeding because of all the sacrifices they had made. they had not seen their family in 25 years.

and so when i went to elementary school, middle school, i was really—i was dedicated. in seventh grade, i was named the gladiator of the year at my middle school because i was the student that showed—ironically the most citizenship. and so just programs like that, but i could not take advantage of them because when once i turned the age of going to college, i couldn't have a way out.

i was afraid for many years until finally a counselor at my college, at the college at college of southern nevada at that time knew what was happening and helped guide me and i became involved in politics. and knowing that i didn't have to be afraid from myself because there was something, and i met other people that we're in the same situation as myself, which is something that never happened before.

: erica—that his mom. part of our jobs as mom is to embarrass our children at any possible moment, but also when we're proud of them to show that pride. so, i'm happy that they're there.

erica, how did you end up here with us today?

erica: i'm here to basically share my story. i came to the united states when i was two years old. my parents and i made the journey here after we lost my little sister. they basically wanted to give me a better future. i now have a 17-year-old brother. he's a u.s. citizen. and now with my parents would qualify if the lawsuit was lifted.

i'm currently going to cfs. i want to major in political science and psychology. and i'm just here wondering what are your plans to help my community and help my family and help us not to live in fear anymore?

: yes. now that's why i think it so important that we continue to try to change the laws comprehensively. but as i have said numerous times, i support the president's action in the face of in action.

i was personally very disappointed that when i was a senator for eight years, we had a few chances to try to do more for dreamers, do more for comprehensive immigration reform, and we were not successful.

and then when i was secretary of state, i was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the senate for comprehensive immigration reform. and it was such a good signal that democrats and republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. and the senate passed it and the house of representatives would never take it up.

and i think it would have passed if they had taken it up. but i think that they—the leadership in the house decided that politically they didn't want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform.

but i think we have to keep working on it. and that is why your stories are so important because we can't look at it as though it is some kind of abstraction. it's real people's lives and so many people who have made contributions, who have worked hard in school, who have started businesses, who have raised their children here.

and as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a u.s. citizen. so it's—we have a lot of these blended families and i want to do more to make sure that doca and dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. i would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. but the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our congress and try to resolve all of this.

: i'm 26 years. and i have been here since i was one year old. i graduated this summer with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. and unfortunately, when i was 15 years old, both my parents and i we received orders for deportation. and since that day we have lived in fear.

thankfully, because of the production i have some relief, but unfortunately, i can't do the same thing from my parents. unless the lawsuit again, stop or is dropped, my parents' future isn't secure here in united states. and as a current documented immigrant here in the united states, i stand for me with the 50,000 undocumented transgender immigrants in this country who lack resources to get any legal representation to file within the one-year deadline for asylum.

so my question, secretary , is would you lift the one-year deadline for asylum-seekers?

: well, i think there's several things about that question that i'd like to answer of. one is i think that people in the immigration system should be represented. and we have made some progress on that, but not enough. and so i am in favor, particularly for young people, to have representation.

i'd like everyone to have it. but if we have to, you know, try to prioritize, i would like young people, i would like people from vulnerable populations, who would otherwise not have the support that they need. and i don't think there's anything magic about the one-year. i think that as part of comprehensive reform, we need to look at how we make our entire system more humane.

i also—i'm very worried about detention and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable, and four children, that i think we could do a better job if we kept detention to people who have a record of violence, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category. and i don't think we should put, you know, children and vulnerable people into big detention facilities because i think they are at risk. i think that their physical and mental health are at risk.

so, these are issues that we should go as far as we can to get the resources to provide support and particularly representation and change some of our detention processes within the kind of discretion that i think the president has exercised with his executive orders. but it's also clear as the president has said many times a lot of these issues can only be resolved once and for all if we have changes in the law.

so, i want to protect people. i want more humane treatment. no matter how the law currently is written or how it's enforced. and to put the resources behind doing that and then continue to fight for comprehensive reform. thank you. wanda

: thank you, secretary  for being here and hearing our story and welcome to nevada.

: thank you.

: i arrived to the united states when i was seven months old. nevada is the only place i call home. and i grew up here. i went to school here. i graduate in university of nevada  with two degrees here, education as you've mentioned earlier is one of our strong points as dreamers.

and because of it, i'm looking at pursuing a law degree. but, again, the system of immigration messes up my family.  in our family.

i come from a mixed status family. meaning my sister is a u.s. citizen who petitioned from my father to change the legal status, and he became a legal permanent resident. when we planned to do the same for my mother, unfortunately, she faces the three tenure bar. because of it, it was either make the decision to have her either separate our family or keep our family together. and a strong message in the immigration community is keeping our families together, and that is the path what we took.

: right.

: unfortunately, she continues to be undocumented. i have—and what the president executive action, she will qualify for , thankfully, but unfortunately with the lawsuit we—it's another obstacle in the way.

: wanda could you explain for people who might not know what the three and 10 rule is because it causes a lot of these issues.

: of course. for example, my mother and i, we entered—the term—legal term enter by infection but we use the term the illegally. my father in his case entered with a work permit. so, he entered legally. and because of it, we faced a 3 to 10 year bar because we way we entered to our journey. we took a different way compared to my father.

so because of it, we face 3-10 year bar, we would have to leave our country. we tried to do it the right way undocumented community. but we had to leave the country for 3 to 10 years as a pardon for entering illegally into the country.

: well, i think your example illustrates the difficulties of these rules that are applied to everybody under every circumstance without looking at the underlying situation. and you have a sister who is a citizen. you have a father who is now a legal permanent resident. you came here at seven months and you have done extremely well with your education, and you're obviously a very committed young person. and your mother, who kept the family going as moms do would have to leave for the 3 to 10-year period in order to be able to petition for reentry and therefore be determined as legal.

that's why i have promoted, ever since, you know, we've been having this debate, going back to when i was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. you'd probably, you know, we'd want you to learn english which is not a problem before anybody around this table. and we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you'd be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in.

so, i think there are—there's agreement among the people who supported the bipartisan bill in the senate even though—i guess some of them are paying a political price for it right now, nevertheless, it was the right thing that they may get it, it is still the right thing.

because we have gained so much from people who—like your families have come here and work hard and made a contribution. so, thank you for explaining that and it shows how difficult it is in so many families to be able to figure out what to do.

and juan, you have an interesting story because you are a one of those small businessmen. you know, i said the other day i wan to be the president for small business because that's where most jobs created and that's where i think the real engine of economic recovery and growth comes from. so, why don't you tell us what you've been doing?

: my name is juan salazar. i'm 22 years old. i came here when i was seven when i was young. i grew up here. this is all i know, the place i called home. and i'm undocumented. i struggled when i get—it hit me when i got out of high school. it was hard to find a job.

in high school, i found my friends were getting these jobs or getting their drivers license becoming more independent. you know, i got left behind.

but—fortunately, thanks to daca, i was able to get a work permit and i'll tell you—and i could tell us pick from all of us undocumented or immigrant. i did not take no opportunity for granted. we don't take an opportunities for granted and i feel like we don't get those a lot. and right away i went to go get my business license and—to—i have my own pool cleaning service. so my own company and me and my . and we started off with three pools. and i got my business license. i went to get certified. and, you know, to promote my name and everything.

and you know, two or three years later, now, we have over 50 pools. and, you know, i am growing as to . i make sure that i work hard because when we didn't have anything, when my dad lost his job, when the decision hit, we lost our house. we didn't have work. we had to sell food to pay the phone bills. and, you know, i was the only going way up from there.

and we're working hard every day. and, you know, i'm only learning through the struggles that we've been through, and taking it step-by-step.

: i'm very proud to hear your story. of course, i mean, let's face it, you can clean pools all year round in nevada. we have a shorter season where i live. but the fact that, you know, you and your dad really were determined to recover from losing your home, losing his job, and just doing what you had to do to be as successful as possible, is the american story.

i mean that is what is so moving to me about what happened to you.

: yes. and, you know, i felt—at least  for once i got the . i got my work's permit, but i cannot say the same thing for my parents because they don't qualify for that type of—because, you know, we are all undocumented. so it was just, you know, i'm happy for the ones who were able to. but now they have a speed bump because...

: right.

: ... they've got to slow down now. and i just want to make sure my parents are protected  any minute. and i would not wish that on anybody.

: right.

: our family separated that far. so, you know, right here in nevada, 21 percent of the business are owned by immigrants. so we are making a lot of—we are moving up here and we're making a difference. all we want is work and, you know, provide for our families. and we're very united—me and my family. so...

: that's great. well, i think that you put an important statistic, which is nationally, not just in nevada, so many of the new small businesses are started by immigrants. and that's something we should be celebrating, not trying to prevent or breakup, because of status differences.

and also on the fact that you're so worried about your parents. i mean i will certainly try to do everything i can to, you know, avoid family breakup, avoid the kind of terrible experience that too many families have already gone through, because they were split up. and half of their family, or the breadwinner in their family, you know, picked up and gone one day.

so that's just—it's not smart and it's not right. do you want to share your story?

: my name is . i am 16 years old. i'm a junior and went to high school. it's either medical minor program. i arrived in this country at the age of two. and since then, i thank the dedication of my parents. i have been able to succeed in school. i have...

: yes.

: currently, as a junior, i continue and start to look towards my future. but once i began to look at what i have in my future, there is not a lot open. i mean, yes, think that guy could go to school, but afterwards, what is there for me? like, i want to be a doctor. i want to go to yale.

: ok.

: but, after yale, i can't really become a doctor since my lack of

: well, i think should brag on you. you may be a junior but you have the highest grade point average in the whole class, right? and i think one of your counselors told me it was 4.8. i didn't even know they went that high.

so you are exactly the kind of student that every family—that every community should be proud of. and the idea that you want to be a doctor is something we should be encouraging and trying to clear the path so you can go on and do that. tell me about your family. what happened with the rest of your family?

: my—both of my parents also arrived as undocumented.

: ok.

: so i —and they were both depending on daca. my specifically, he bright future to open up his own mechanic shop which he could be currently a mechanic. and with that, he would be able to expand his business. however, since the delay he really can't.

: well, i think it's important to, you know, put faces behind the stories. several of you have mentioned how the lawsuit tried to prevent the implementation of president obama's executive order has really stopped the plan—stopped plans for new businesses, stopped plans for going to school, or what you're going to do when you graduate just creating more uncertainty.

and that is what you are describing with respect to your father. yes. you know, i think that certainty is really important, predictability, regularization, if you will. people need to know what's going to happen. and it is just unrealistic, and i think, foolish to continue to talk as though we're going to deport 11 million or 12 million people. that is not going to happen.

and so, when you accept the fact that is not going to happen...

: no.

: ... right? i once calculated when i was in the senate how much money it would cost, how many buses would be required. i mean it's just, you know, it's beyond absurd. that's not going to happen. so then, what we have to do is accept the fact we are a nation of immigrants. it always have been. i think it was franklin roosevelt who might have said that we started off as a nation of revolutionaries and immigrants. and that has continued throughout our history.

so we have to solve the issues that are around this situation that we are faced with. and the facts are really clear about the contributions, the economic consumer contributions, the paying of taxes contributions, and then the young people who work hard and are looking for a place in society.

so i know that you each have had very personal experiences. and now is your chance to maybe say what you think should be done and how it should be done so that we have, you know, a debate that is about the realities, not about, you know, the talking points and the arguments. esther , would you like to start?

: well, secretary, i think one of the most important things for us is family unification. as you mentioned, 11 million people could not be deported. however, millions have already been deported.

we have here with us victoria. she's also a dreamer who received daca. she hasn't seen her mother in four years because they had to go back to mexico for an emergency. and on the way back, her mother was unfortunately—broke her leg on the journey back to the united states. and victoria came here alone. so she's been with a guardian for the past four years.

and to me, one of the questions is what will happen to those families who've already been separated? thankfully, i go to bed every night and, you know, i live in the fear that my parents will be deported, but they're still here.

: right.

: i can talk to them and i can see them. you know, and i think all of our stories have very complex issues where juan working and his family's also makes status family all tired of it. you know, we all have siblings which two to three to 10 year bar. our parents would qualify for adjustment. unfortunately, that's still in place.

so my question is a little bit expanding on several of those issues.

: yes. no, i think that reunification should be one of our goals in comprehensive immigration reform because, you know, we have attempted to deal with this challenge for years now and in the absence of actually finally passing comprehensive immigration reform, a lot of families have been broken up.

and that's just really so painful for people who live through it, but even for those of us on the outside looking at it to even imagine what that must be like. and that's why i want to do everything we can to defend the president's executive orders because i think they were certainly within his authority. constitutionally, legally, they were based on precedent that i believe is adequate. and then, still try to go further and deal with some of these other issues, like the reunification of families that were here and that have been split up since the last eight, 10, 12 years. yes.

: for me, if there's 276,000 undocumented lgbt immigrants here in the united states, around 15 to 50 of them are trans. so as a lesbian woman, i'd like to know how we can protect our trans brothers and sisters from being put into institutions where they don't identify with their gender identity?

: well, that's what rafael was also referring to earlier. and look i think that we have to do more to provide safe environments for vulnerable populations. and that certainly includes the lgbt community, also includes children, and it includes unaccompanied children. there are just a—there are groups of people who i think we deserve a higher level of care, because of the situations that they are finding themselves in.

i also think that we have to reform our detention system. i've, you know, i'm not sure a lot of americans know that a lot of the detention facilities for immigrants are run by private companies and that they have a built in incentive to fill them up, that there is actually a legal requirement that so many beds be filled. so people go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per bed basis. i mean that just makes no sense at all to me. i mean that's not the way we should be running any detention facility.

so i think there is a lot we have to do to change what is currently happening and to try to put us on a path toward a better, fairer, or more humane system for everybody. yes.

: i think our court ability is a major factor. many undocumented immigrants have been exploited. personally, my parents were actually exploited. when they were at—to this country, they had to work for $2 an hour. that was actually in 1990.

i also think that since many of these—many of our parents have actually, you know, had a work in a little wage jobs in order to, you know, to move up. i think it's also important to raise the minimum wage throughout the country and—because i think people deserve to make a living wage.

: yes. no, i agree with that completely. i am very much in favor of raising the minimum wage at the federal level. states and some cities are on their own raising the minimum wage. but i think there needs to be a federal floor. and i believe that the democrats in the senate are going to introduce legislation to do just that in the week. so i agree with you. blanca ?

: secretary , i think the biggest thing is, as you mentioned, you were going to keep the executive—if elected president, you plan to keep the executive order. but as a down, you mentioned as well that you are going to push congress. we look forward—well, personally, and i think all of us at this table look forward to a day where we all become citizens of this country. all of us at the table have knocked doors, phoned banks to get voters out there. and we tell them our stories, because it's so important that they're vote not—it's not only voting for themselves, they are voting for us and the future of this country.

: right.

: so if and when elected, do you plan to push congress as your first initiative, to push for a comprehensive immigration reform?

: well, it certainly be among my first initiatives. i can't—sitting here today—predict what will be happening. i know that happened to president obama when he was elected and found out that we were falling into an economic abyss. and i think he deserves a lot of credit for restabilizing our situation and getting us back on the economic upswing.

so but among the priorities that i would be advocating for—in the beginning would be comprehensive immigration reform. and one of the reasons for that, in addition to everything we've discussed is as secretary of state, i saw what happens to countries that established a second-class status for people.

they do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they're never fully accepted. that is a recipe for divisiveness and even for disintegration. and there fore, my view strongly is that we are a nation of immigrants. we have assimilated tens and tens of millions of people over the course of our history.

: yes.

: we have 11 million, 12 million people right now who are undocumented. the vast majority of whom have proven that they want to be a citizen of this country and we should put them on that path. and those who say, "yes, we can do reform, but not a path to citizenship," would be fundamentally undermining what has made america unique—the way we have assimilated people, the way people who come here feel so loyal, the contributions they make.

so this is not just in my view the right thing to do for america. if you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it's done to them. and i don't want to go there. so i very firmly support a path to citizenship in the context of comprehensive immigration reform. juan?

: i kind of just want to add a little personal story with what rafael said. when i graduated high school, i realized i couldn't find any work. and my dad wasn't working as well. and we found a landscaping job, like a labor for a company. and we're actually getting paid $6 an hour where they would work us like excessively.

and, you know, i was young. and i was just working really, really hard. it's been to a point where you felt like that you'd be humiliated. i remember we'd been working and that the boss was there. we could not look at him in the eye. we could not look at him, and we could not stop working. we hadn't worked harder. and even if it was lunchtime, you had to be working until he left.

and, you know, i was just—there's lots of stories not just like that. there's other stories that we have and i'm through that. it just felt like that and it's really hard. and, you know, me and my dad worked really hard. you know, timber united —so when he would get home from work, and i would see him limping, i don't like, you know, i don't want this for him which is kind of what motivated me to do something for us.

: right.

: and, you know, he's helped me out through all his life and raised me to respect everyone and be honest and, you know, supported me with school. when we didn't have money, i'd still go part-time to see a cent. i don't know how i did it but i was going. and, you know, i just looking out for him. and we can't  united so i'm really glad he's like my business partner.

: i bet he'd say the same thing about you.

: yes.

: but, you know, juan, you make a good point. it's not only about the minimum wage and decent working conditions for people like you and your dad. often times when i have conversations with people who are fearful about immigration reform, their fears are rooted in the feeling that they're losing jobs that are going to people who are undocumented.

and part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you're undocumented. why would they pay somebody who already is a citizen what the minimum wage should be? so my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as though—and to some extent it's true—are losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse.

so my argument to people who worry about comprehensive immigration reform and the effect on their jobs, it's just the opposite. the sooner we can get to legalization, the better the job market will be for everybody. then, employers will not be able to violate the laws—the wage and hour laws for example, because they're not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site.

so this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad.

: yes, of course.

: yes.

: i'll tell you one more question.

: ok.

: i just wanted to say, what do you plan—well, i know here in nevada and this county our education—we keep on like lowering the education. a lot of kids aren't graduating. and i feel like we need to reach out to these kids and...

: right.

: ... show them that school is very important and so is higher education. a lot of kids don't even—they qualify for college—there's not an—maybe we need to figure out some other way. i think a lot of the reason is because of funding.

: yes.

: they can't afford it and they feel discouraged and they just go on...

: right.

: ... and decide not to go to school.

: right. well, look i think that that's a big part of what we have to do to make sure that out economy is competitive and also to make sure that every young person has a chance to continue their education whether it's a community college or college or a job training kind of program that will give them a good start. and you make a really strong point because it's so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feeling—and their parents are feeling it's just beyond their reach.

so that's why i support president obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and i'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education.

so this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as i go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right. too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. they don't know what to do. they can't buy a house, they can't get married, they can't start a business because the have so much in student debt.

and, you know, then, in iowa and in new hampshire, you know, the average student in iowa graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt, and then, the average student in new hampshire, about $32,000 worth of debt. they're at the higher end. nevada is still at the lower end of debt.

but, you know, you also have a lot of people who don't have that much in assets and income. so it's all, you know, relative to what they can afford. so we have to do more on that. and i want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about rancho because i learned today that this school uses title i funds to pay for the a.p. exam fee. this is, you know, this sounds a little archane but i want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education.

it gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there. but too many kids in the past and still across our country don't take the test because—i don't know what it does today—$80?

: $85.

: $85. that's a lot of money if, you know, you're making minimum wage or less. so i want to—i really want to—i don't—i hope that the rancho administrators are still here because—good. the principal is still here. i want to give them a big shout out for using title i funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an a.p. course gets to and gets to take the exam.

so i'm sure, you're going to do some of that next year.  currently. you have them tomorrow?

: i had my chemistry test monday and i have my statistics and english language next monday.

: so you're taking three a.p. exams as a junior?

: yes.

: wow. wow. ok.

:  to education topic?

: sure.

: once daca was brought open—established, it opened doors for many like myself to school to try yale, harvard, et cetera. but oftentimes, the journey ends there and i was wondering if or what was your position or what will you offer in order for us to be able to continue on to our education and become or raised doctors, so on and so forth.

: well, i think it's very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back. we have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year. and they get a great education in our colleges and universities. and then, a lot of them stay.

well, i want you to be a doctor if that's what you want to be. i mean you've come up to our system, you've worked hard, and then you've done exceptionally well. so i think this is the particular fix in addition to the other fixes we've been talking about.

you know, i read an article recently about a group of young, undocumented men who were really interested in technology and they entered a contest against kids from the best schools and companies and they won. and so, you have four kids who beat the best of the best. and they couldn't do anything because they were undocumented.

and i am sitting there thinking, "what is wrong with this picture?" we are in a global competition and i intend for us to win it. and i'm about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away.

so from my perspective we need to fix that, we need to remove the fear, and we need to make sure that we give every child a chance to do the best that he or she can. and if that means going to yale and becoming a doctor i want that to happen.

so, as you can tell, i could be here all day because, you know, six exceptional young people, we have some proud parents and grandparents and teachers here.

but let me and where i started thanking rancho for having me here, thanking each of you for being willing and brave enough to sit here and talk about your own lives. i want to reiterate my strong support for the president's executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which i think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our congress or anywhere else.

and i'm so pleased that the congresswoman is here because i know she's a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today. and i want to get back to good old-fashioned problem-solving. and this is one of the problems we have to solve together.

so i pledge to you i will do everything i possibly can to make this an issue in the campaign but more importantly, when i'm president, to put it on the top of my priority list.

so if you'll stay here, we're going to do a picture. and maybe we could get the rancho—the principal and others to come up and join us, you know. yes. let's get the administrators who invited us all here to come and stand. if you'll just stand with us we will get a picture with everybody. congresswoman, why don't you join us?
thank you. wow. thank you. i am thrilled to be here with all of you.

and sarah, that was excellent. i thank you so much.

and i hope you'll get to know sarah and spend time with her and help her as she works so hard between now and february 1st.

and dean and gary, thank you for welcoming us to your beautiful home; what a delight it is to be here with you.

somebody asked me the other day, well, you know, you're going to these events, where you're taking time to actually talk and listen to people, is that really what you're going to do?

and i said, well, yes, it is because not only do i learn a lot but i also feel like it's the best way to make those connections that will not only give me a firm foundation in the caucus here in iowa or in a primary in new hampshire—because it really is about people-to-people connections if we're really talking about what we want to do—but it will also give me the kind of information i need to be an even better president.

and i just had another example about that. you may know that gary's a radiologist and right before we came in, we were talking about his work. he's an expert in breast cancer. and i asked him about the mammography recommendations that's at least the women in the room i'm sure have seen over the last several years.

and he was giving me some really important insight into the commission that made those recommendations and his expert opinion about them. and i'm so grateful to you for that because it's the kind of discussion that you can't have unless you have an opportunity to actually talk and listen with people.

i want to thank all of you for coming. i am delighted to have this chance to talk with you. i think what we're going to do is i'll say a few words about the campaign and what i want to achieve. and then we'll have a chance to talk individually and i'll be able to hear from each and every one of you.

i have been incredibly impressed over the last several years at how hard the american people have worked to pull ourselves out of the great recession. people have made a lot of sacrifice. people have lost jobs. they lost houses. they lost the chance to finish or go on with their education. and they did everything that they could think of to do to get back on their feet.

and i'm so relieved that, as i travel around the country and talk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. we're not running yet but we are on our feet. and we can see the changes that are happening in people's lives and put them in a context as to where we go from here now as a country.

i'm very grateful to president obama for the hard decisions he made when he inherited the mess that he inherited when he became president in 2009.

and i know that he and i and everyone who was in his administration realizes that, unless the american family and the american worker is strong, everything we want to see happen for our country is going to be much more difficult. and so i come to this campaign committed to being a champion for americans and american families.

that's what my work has been throughout my entire adult life, starting with my first job out of law school when i went to work for the children's defense fund, all the way through to the work that i did as secretary of state promoting women's rights, promoting the rights of people who would otherwise be marginalized or left on the sidelines.

and i know that, although we have to—it's still hard to imagine exactly how we're going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. we know that.

and so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it again.

so when i look at where we are as a nation and where we need to be, i see four big challenges that we have to take on together. and there are going to be fights, because they're—if they were easy, they would already be done. so i will posit that right now.

number one, we have to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. it needs to be innovative. it needs to be sustainable. it needs to be producing good jobs with rising wages. we need to get back into the habit of actually rewarding workers with increases in their paychecks for the increases in productivity and profitability that they have helped to bring about.

you know, warren buffett has said it, but so have a lot of other people. there's something wrong when the average american ceo makes 300 times more than the typical american worker or when hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers.

in fact, i heard a statistic the other day that really made a big impact on me, that the top 25 hedge fund managers together made more money than all the kindergarten teachers in america.

and when you think about value, what it is that's going to get us moving again, i think kindergarten teachers are really important. and so——and we've got to make a claim on becoming the 21st century clean energy superpower. iowa has really helped us. the rfs, the renewable fuel standard and a lot of the investments that have made here, has been one of the reasons why we have made some real progress but not near enough. and other countries are going to seize that title unless we do what we have to.

it's also imperative that we give people the tools through education and job training and skills not just in rhetoric but in reality so that they can make the most out of their own lives. and for me that starts at the very beginning.

i have been a child advocate and a child development proponent for my entire adult life because it's what i really care about, what i believe in. and i think we have to start before kindergarten. we have to have universal pre-k but we also have to do more to reach out to families so they know the tools they should use to be their children's first teachers.

now we've got this new granddaughter who is unbelievable. and we were with her this weekend. you know, we go and just stare at her. i mean, that's what—it's really—it's wonderful and silly at the same time.

but we also read to her. here she is, 7.5 months old, we're reading and reading and reading. and i imagine among her first words were—will be, you know, "enough with the reading," because between her mom and her dad and bill and i, we're constantly doing that.

but we're doing it not only because we love to do it and we love to see her begin to reach her hands out and grab onto the books, we're doing it because we know that it aids her brain development. that has been one of the great discoveries with brain research in the last couple of decades.

we increasingly can see what happens when you are literally feeding the brain as well as the body of these infants and then the babies and the toddlers. that will help them be better prepared when they actually end up in kindergarten and it will begin to close the achievement gap because, you know, we're going to do everything we can for our granddaughter. charlotte will get every opportunity we can possibly imagine.

but what kind of country will she grow up in?

and what kind of world will she enter?

and what will happen to all of the other infants, babies, toddlers and children in our country today?

so we have to look at education from the very beginning. then we have to make sure that we are doing all we can to empower our teachers, to make sure that they have the support of parents so that they can do the job they have been trained to do to help prepare our kids.

and then we've got to make sure that college is affordable. and that cannot happen at the rate we're going unless we change the way we fund college education for young people who wish to have that experience.

many of us in this room, i bet, as i did, borrowed money to go to college. but then we were able to pay it back because it wasn't such an overwhelming burden as it has become now.

the average student in iowa graduates with $30,000 in debt and that then makes it very difficult for them to start a business or buy a new home or even get married, as one young man told me not so long ago.

so we have to deal with the indebtedness to try to move toward making college as debt-free as possible. i'm 100 percent behind president obama's proposal for free community college. we've got to try to get that through.

and then we've got to try to do everything we can to make college available and affordable to all of our young people.

you know, when you think about our economy today, it is absolutely linked to education. it is also linked to strong families and strong communities. and that's our second challenge, because a lot of families and communities have been under tremendous strain.

one of the biggest stresses in anybody's life is health care. i will fight to protect the affordable care act and i will work to make the changes that are required.

we are really now in a different world, 16 million people who didn't have health insurance who now do. we have to do everything we can to make sure that medicare is as available and protected and affordable as possible. and we have to be sure that where there are changes that can be made we try to find ways to work across the aisle to make them.

i don't hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking as much as they used to about getting rid of the affordable care act. i think the reason is is because there are a lot of people that they may actually be encountering from time to time who have been helped. and we need to make sure to make the argument over and over again, what will you do if you say to people we're going to take away the health care we finally have been able to provide for you? that is just unacceptable.

but there are some problems. you know, one of the problems—and i heard about this in iowa—is what happens when a 26-year old becomes a 27-year old and is no longer eligible to be on his or her parents' policy? that was one of the best changes in the affordable care act. and the fact is that a lot of young people aren't making the income they need yet to be able to afford their own health care. so we have to look out to see what we're going to be able to do to help them.

there are two issues that fall into this category that are huge strains on families. and i heard about them first—i heard first in davenport and i heard about it all the way across the state until i got to council bluffs. one is the drug epidemic—meth, pills in iowa and then i got to new hampshire.

and at my very first coffee shop meeting i heard about the heroin epidemic in new hampshire. in the past year i've been told reliably we had more people die of drug overdoses in america than automobile accidents for the first time in our history.

this is tearing families apart but it is below the surface. people aren't talking about it because it's something that is hard to deal with.

i also heard a lot about untreated mental health problems. and so many communities, so many states turning their backs on people with mental health problems. facilities are being closed. even though we now require there to be treatment in the affordable care act, there's not enough available treatment. not enough resources.

the other day, i was in california at an event. and i just said what i said. i said, you know, mental health is not being treated. we claim we're now going to be able to help people with their health care problems, but if we don't help with mental health, we're leaving out a huge number of people. and a young woman came up to me and asked me a question. she said, "did you know that we're having all these suicides in my high school?" i said, "no, i did not know that before i came." she goes, "well, we've had four young people kill themselves in the last months."

then i was in new york at an event this past way. said the same thing that i said to you, and then i was visiting with people. and a woman come up—came up to me and she goes, "thank you for mentioning mental health. we have gone in the last six months to four funerals of friends of my children who have killed themselves."

i have to tell you, when i started running, when i started thinking about this campaign, i did not believe i would be standing in your living room talking about the drug abuse problem, the mental health problem and the suicide problem. but i am now convinced i have to talk about it. i have to do everything i can in this campaign to raise it...  ...to end the stigma against talking about it.

and we also have a challenge that affects everything we do, and that is to fix our dysfunctional political system. and that—that underlies everything that we can possibly hope to get done. i'm very committed to meeting with anybody, going to have any conversation, to try to find common ground. but we also have to stand our ground. and we have to try to figure out how we're going to get people to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of people who need a good positive support system, whether it be health care of aid for college, or anything else.

we also have to address the unaccountable dark money in politics. i think the supreme court made a grave error with its citizens united decision. and i will do everything i can do to appoint supreme court justices who will protect the right to vote, and not the right of billionaires to buy elections.

and, you know, i've been consulting with a lot of legal experts. and some of them think there may be a way to get legislation through that will enable us to regulate this kind of use of money in our political system which is so corruptive and corrosive. but others agree with former justice john paul stevens, who recently wrote a book in which he said it's going to take a constitutional amendment. i will work for that if that's the only way to fix this problem, because we cannot continue with the kind of assault on our democracy, on voting rights, and on the opportunity for us to know where the money is coming from that influences our political system.

now, for us , we have challenges around the world. i was coming through the—the garage, there's a tv that dean and gary have, and it was talking about isis in iraq. we have threats that we know of. that we can begin to try to figure out how best to address. it's not just dictators. also disease, climate change, which—i think global warming is a threat to us. but we have to be confident and strong in understanding that there are many ways to approach the problems that america will be confronting in the world. and we must do so in cooperation with our friends, our allies, our fellow democracies around the world.

i am convinced that the 21st century can once again be a century in which the united states leads and helps to set the values and the standards. but we have to have an agreement, first of all, foremost, with our own country and in our own congress about how to do that. i was outraged, and said at the time, that when a group of republican senators sent a letter to the ayatollah of iran, in a—essentially criticizing the actions of the president of the united states—i don't care what party you are. we have one president, and we should stand behind that president when he's trying to work out very difficult problems.

so, i know there are a lot of hard choices ahead of us. i wrote a book called "hard choices." there is it. there is it. i'll sign that for you. but i think we're more than up to it. you know, i am a confident optimist about where america's future lies. that doesn't mean i'm not aware of how difficult it is. i'm going into this race with my eyes wide open about how hard it is to be the president of the united states. i have a little experience about that. and i have to tell you, i find it, you know, very reassuring because i do have that experience to know what's possible and how best to proceed. but i also know that we are living in an incredibly complicated time in american history. it is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines. those are all great. that's part of campaigning.

but at the end of the day, we need a president who has both the experience and the understanding to deal with the complexity of the problems that we face. and i appreciate what both dean and sarah said about the experiences that i've been privileged to have during the last decades. i really believe that i can go into that office on the very first day and begin to do what is required.

so i look forward to visiting with each and every one of you. i look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses. i would be honored to have your support on february 1st. and then i will need your help as we move toward the general election because i don't want this election to be about me. i want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country.

you know, when i campaigned so hard against then-senator obama, i was, you know, working as hard as i could. he was working as hard as he could. and at the end of the day, he won. and then i went to work to make sure he got elected our president. and i was so relieved and happy when that finally happened.

the sunday after the election, bill and i went for a walk in an area that sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we'd been working so hard to elect then-president-elect obama. so we're wandering through the woods, and bill's phone rings, which is sort of a miracle since we have terrible cell coverage there. and he pulled it out of his pocket and it was the president-elect. and he said, "you know, i'd like to talk to you and hillary." and bill said, "well, we're kind of in the middle of a forest. can we get home and call you back?"

and so we did. and when he called back—when bill called back, he talked to the president-elect and then i talked to him. and he said to me, "i want you to come see me in chicago." and i said, "sure. when?" he goes, "as soon as you can get here." and i said, "well, ok." so the following thursday, i went to chicago and he asked me if i would serve as secretary of state.

and i said, "you know, mr. president-elect, i, you know, i really want to go back to the senate. i'm very flattered, but there are a lot of other people who could do that." "no," he said. "i know what i want and i want you to do this." i said, "well, you know, mr. president-elect, i really want to go back to the senate and that's where i think i can best work with you and best serve you." he goes, "look," he said, "i don't want to hear from you again until you say yes."  so, you know, i told him "no," you know, again later. and he just said, "don't—don't call me until you say yes." and i did tell my husband, i said, "he's so persistent. i've told him no twice and he keeps saying, you know, i'm waiting for you to say yes." and bill said, "yeah, well, i asked you to marry me twice before you said yes."

so i guess there's a connection there. so then i—i stayed up that night and i—i thought, you know, supposed i'd been honored to win, and i had wanted this incredibly talented american to be in my cabinet and i'd asked him, i'd want him to say yes. and i thought, you know, what's what i have to do.

so i called him and i said, "you know, president-elect, i would be honored to serve in your cabinet." and we immediately got starting to work. a few months later, on my very first trip as secretary of state, i went to asia. and i went in part because everybody i called, all of the leaders in the countries that i spoke with, were saying, "you know, we just don't know whether the united states cares about us anymore; nobody's been paying any attention to us; you know, we're—we're kind of feeling like we're not important to you anymore." i said, "well, you are, and the president feels that way; i feel that way; i will come see you."

so i went out. and one of the countries that i went to was indonesia, in part because it's a very important country, but also president obama had a personal connection with it. and my idea was not only to talk to the leaders, but to talk to the people, what's called public diplomacy. so that as you were—as i was out there talking to presidents and prime ministers and others, i would also find ways of trying to connect to to tell people, "look, the united states really does care about the world we're trying to create together, and that's part of my message from our new president."

so i went on a—i agreed to go on a show in jakarta, which was their morning show. and it was like a combination of mtv and a reality show and all that. i had no idea what i was getting myself into. and so i go onto the set and people are jumping and they're singing and they're dancing. and it's called "the awesome show."

so i'm on "the awesome show," and i'm talking a little bit to the interviewer. and then they ask people if they have any questions. and somebody in the audience says, "i want to ask you, we saw you campaigned very hard against president obama; he campaigned very hard against you. he won. you lost. and then he asked you to be his secretary of state. why?"

and i realized, you know, in a lot of these new democracies and other places of course, you run against somebody and you lose, you could get exiled or imprisoned, even killed; not asked to be secretary of state. and so this was a very legitimate question. and i thought, "i have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections," at least that's what we should be doing. i said, "well, you're right. we campaigned hard. he won. i lost. i then campaigned to get him elected. he asked me to be secretary of state, and i said yes for the same reason: we both love our country."

and at the end of the day to me...  ...that's what elections are supposed to be about. we can disagree and we will. we'll have all kinds of arguments, even, about the best way to do things. but we should be coming from a place of love—of loving our country and of respecting one another. and we have to rebuild this feeling in our country again.

we have too much work to be done. we have too many people who deserve a better shot at a future for themselves and their families. i want to be their champion. and with your help, i will get up every single day doing the best i can to make sure that the country we love is the country we deserve to have.

thank you all.

well first let me thank all of you in particular our round table participants for being with us today and thanks to bike tech for welcoming us to this amazing facility. i'm delighted to have this chance to talk more about small businesses. but i want to begin with what's happening more broadly with america's economy and america's families. because i've always believed fundamentally that when our families are strong, our country is strong.

and we've come back from very tough economic times. i don't need to tell anybody here that. our economy and our country are in much better shape today, and in large measure because families worked so hard. they took extra jobs, they skipped vacations, they scrimped and they postponed going to college they saved and made it work.

but the deck is still stacked for those at the top.

people aren't getting a fair shake. something is wrong when ceos earn more than 300 times than what the typical american worker earns and when hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a truck drivers or nurses.

i'm running for president because everyday americans and their families need a champion and i want to be that champion. i want families to do more than just get by — i want you to get ahead and stay ahead. i want to make the words "middle class" mean something again.

now, small businesses like bike tech and the ones you'll here about today have to be at the heart of that effort — creating jobs, driving growth, and giving millions of americans the chance to live up to their god-given potential.

now, i did not learn this from politics — i learned it from my father who was a small business man. he had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them. my mother, my brothers and i and occasionally a few day laborers would help out with the actual printing process. that's what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home.

today, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time. businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future.

but the deck is stacked here as well. ask any small business owner, as i have, and they'll tell you: it is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan. it shouldn't take longer to start a business in america than it does in canada and france! but that is the fact.

i want to be a small business president. a president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity. we have to level the playing field for our small businesses.

first, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out. we should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that's where many of the obstacles still lie.

second, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole.

third, we'll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it's across town, across the state, or across the world. that's what i did in partnership with ebay in upstate new york when i was a senator. we started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away.

fourth, and i want to emphasize this today, i will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire… including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers. and this morning when i was reading the des moines register — big head line: report: iowa ranks last for women owned business. this could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says iowa has made some progress it says iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in iowa and all the states and the district of columbia. so this is a very important issue for our whole county but i think it is especially important for our friends here in iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones.

and you shouldn't have to be a fortune 500 company to get a loan.

for many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties. but today those same local banks are being squeezed by regulations that don't make sense for their size and mission. like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions. and when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans. we can ease these burdens for community banks without harming consumers — and without easing up one bit on the wall street. we should not apply the same restrictions on community banks as those needed by the big banks.

let's be clear about this: it's not the big banks that need relief from washington — it's small banks and small businesses. we should be doing more to rein in risky behavior on wall street and "too big to fail," banks not less.

i fully support the regulations in dodd-frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a trojan horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks — as we're seeing right now in what republicans are introducing — we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top.

our goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have. to make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead.

so i'm eager to hear the ideas from everyone around the table. and i see some elected officials in the audience and am eager to hear your ideas. what are the obstacles you've faced and how can you overcome them? what more can we do to help small businesses grow?

wow, what a great way to begin and to all of you especially mary carmen and lakeisha thank you for speaking on behalf of providers and parents. we're going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today. i want to thank everyone at new horizons for welcoming us to this facility. and to all my friends at seiu as well.

we're here today to talk about childcare. but its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we're talking about the economy, we're talking about families, we're talking about fairness, we're talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today. i want to say just a few words about what's happening with our economy and more broadly about america's families. because i think when our families are strong america is strong. and if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better.

we've come back from really tough economic times. the great recession just really knocked people to the ground. people lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. it really took a lot out of everybody. and we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. they took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. so everybody made it work.

but the deck is still stacked for those at the top. something is wrong when top ceos earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and i heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we're talking about today, if you take the salaries, the compensation, of the top 25 hedge fund managers in america, those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together. now i happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families.

and i'm running for president because i think everyday americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything i can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. i want you to get ahead and stay ahead. i want to make the words "middle class" mean something again.

now, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. i was born in chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family i was born into. most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. and 40 percent of moms, just like lakeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. so that's a big different from the way it was when i and others here were growing up. yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. you know i can remember very well when i was a young lawyer before i had my daughter in my law firm where i worked in arkansas, around 3 o'clock i'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and i didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. and it wasn't accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. but that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love.

so we know that with moms and dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you mary carmen saying you work 17 hours, it's hard to even find time to breathe. and many can't count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet.

so finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. but it's also harder than ever.

federal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. so it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. and now the republican budget that is being worked on by the congress would cut funding even more. making it so much more difficult. america cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. family values are economic values. i'm going to be putting forth plans to fix this. we should do it now. and republicans should either get on board or get out of the way.

because it's now time for us to face reality. our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. and i'm very clear about what i think needs to be done but i want to hear from all of you because what i'm doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas i have, some of which i have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care.

first, to bring down out-of-control family costs, we need to make investments in childcare a national priority.

what president obama has proposed is a good start. i'll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it's providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers. whatever its going to take to give both lakeisha and the providers more opportunities. and you know its embarrassing, i traveled to 112 countries as your secretary of state, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. and the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. every other country has something that says, we think it's really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it's important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing. so we've got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care. and many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. there are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. we have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. that doesn't make any sense to me at all.

so to all the childcare workers here today, i want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. you should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that.

now i am a new grandmother and it's really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what i believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change americans' future. it makes it harder to retain the best staff. it makes it harder to keep up those high standards.

so we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. there is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.

that's why i so respect the vital work that seiu is doing, under the leadership of president mary kay henry, is so vital. i think it is absolutely essential.

and i want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, i agree, because i want every child to have the best possible education. but education starts at birth. education starts when that little baby comes into the world. in fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. if we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. that's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. so yea, we're going to make sure that charlotte has every chance in the world but i want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances.

ultimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. you see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. you want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that god-given potential. and i'm here because i want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every american, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of america.

so for me, this is as important an as anything else that i'm going to talk about in my campaign for president. thank you.
well, this is so exciting, to be here with all of you and to be here for such an important cause, to make sure that the democratic party and particularly the democratic women's council recruits and trains and fields more women for public office right here in south carolina. there are a lot of longtime friends here; i won't try to mention everybody, but i do want to thank susan and the entire board for dwc. and i want to thank gilda, who i think has been in the state legislature since '92, started in elementary school and worked her way up. former governor jim hodges, we're delighted he is here, thank you. a national democratic chair, a state democratic chair, of course don and carroll fowler, so happy to see them. your candidate for the senate last time, joyce dikerson, thank you joyce.

i was thinking on the way down here that i first came to south carolina as a young lawyer working for the children's defense fund, started by your own south carolina native marian wright edelman from bennettsville. i came back many times going to renaissance weekend, going to hilton head, then going to charleston. made a lot of friends, had a lot of good times, and am thrilled to be back, and i'm back because i want to support you.

you know, the theme of this day of events is how to build a party and how to build a party that really respects and includes women and gives women in this state a chance to not only be at the table but at the head of the table. carrying with them their democratic experiences and their life experiences. and you're right, i am running to live again at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. but i don't want to be there all by myself—i want democrats elected from the local to the county to the state to the federal level, once again making the case that when democrats win, americans win.

i want to say just a few words about what's happening to america's families and what's happening with our economy. because i've always believed fundamentally that when families are strong, america is strong.

and we've come through some really tough economic times. i looked at the statistics and south carolina has pulled itself up and other places have as well. american families have made a lot of sacrifices. people lost jobs, people lost homes, people had to put college on the back burner, retirement on the back burner. but everybody just kept going. it took a lot of determination, and across america we're beginning to see the results of all that hard work. and i will say that there does seem to be a pattern, democratic presidents, and there are two in particular that i'm thinking of, over the last 35 years, seem to inherit a mess of problems. have you noticed that? so then they have to dig us out of the ditches they find themselves in and put us back on the right track, and of course i'm talking about bill clinton and barrack obama, but of course presidents don't do it alone—they do it with the american people. it's a partnership.

and today we are standing again, but we're not yet running. and we face a choice: are we going to hand over our country once again to people and policies that crashed our economy before and that will shred all the progress we've made?


well that's obviously the right answer, but that's what this campaign is going to be about. because we're going to have to stand up to the people who want to keep the deck stacked in favor of those at the top. we are going to fight to make sure that the success of our country is shared across the economy and that more families have the chance to get ahead and not just to get by but to stay moving forward with the kind of confidence and optimism that has always marked the best times in america.

it's time to make the words "middle class" mean something again. they should represent a solemn promise that anyone willing to work hard can earn a decent living and a better life, not just get by paycheck to paycheck.

that's the middle class i grew up in. my dad was a small businessman, and when i say small, it was small. he ran a small drapery printing business. and he literally had a print plant with big long tables that had silk screens, and sometimes my mother, my brothers, and i would help to pour the paint in and take the squeegee and then we'd walk down the table, print the fabrics, and then he'd go out and sell them. and it was a good decent middle-class life that he provided to my brothers and me. and i am so grateful, and there was never in my mind in fact that's what so many of us believed when we were growing up. the future seemed so unlimited—of course we had to fix a lot of things in the country, starting with civil rights and human rights, but the opportunity ladder always was held out there.

i just came from kiki's chicken and waffles, which i highly recommend, and i was meeting with a group of african american businesswomen, and they were telling me what they needed to keep growing and build an even better future, it sounded so much like the conversation i remember around my dinner table. that's what links us together past all the other differences that sometimes divide us.

being middle class in america should mean you feel in control of your own financial destiny.

it should mean you have a little more, so you can worry a little less.

it should mean that you can invest in your future and the future of your children, putting aside some for education, putting aside some for retirement.

you should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that everything you've worked for won't be lost in a flash because of decisions that are made or failed to be made in washington.

so therefore, i want to be a president who makes corporations live up to the basic guarantee that when workers help produce record profits, those workers should get a real share of the rewards instead of it all going to those at the top.

and you know the statistic. something is wrong when top ceos earn 300 times more than a typical american worker, or here is my latest least favorite statistic, the 25 biggest hedge fund managers earn more than all the kindergarten teachers in america...combined. what does that say about our values and the importance of preparing our children through education to make it in a very competitive global economy?

today, too many politicians who want to return to the same failed top-down economics are mouthing the words "middle class." but this is something you have to believe in and something you have to be ready to fight for. if those words are going to have meaning again, they've got to be backed up by real solutions, not empty rhetoric. and those solutions have to speak to the ways that the economy has changed.

today, 40 percent of mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in their household. and more americans are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. parents are rushing home from work to get their kids home from school and maybe get them off to practice or rehearsal. they are squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day with barely enough time to breathe, let alone relax.

i remember when i was a practicing lawyer back in little rock, and around 3 o'clock every afternoon all of the women who worked in the firm were hunched over their phones kind of whispering into them and at first i didn't know what was going on, and then i realized they were checking to see if their children got home safely.

many people today can't count on relatives to pitch in because so many families now are scattered across the country. now i happen to be extremely lucky because my amazing 8-month-old granddaughter lives near me, so i get to see her a lot.

but nobody expects everything to come easy, that's not part of life, we know that, but it shouldn't be quite so hard to get ahead and stay ahead.

so i do believe that everyday americans and their families need a champion. a champion who will fight for them every single day. not for some americans but for all americans. and i want to be that champion. i want to get up every single day going to work for you, standing up for you, making a difference for you.

now, take the issue of equal pay. i don't think i'm letting you in on a secret when i say, too many women still earn less than men on the job. and women of color often make even less. and then there's the so called, motherhood penalty, with many women taking a pay cut when they have children. all this lost money adds up. for many families, we're talking about thousands of dollars every year. that's money that could go for rent or groceries or a new car or into the college fund. now we could fix this. if republicans would get on board, we in fact could fix this today but they won't.

one republican candidate dismissed equal pay as "a bogus issue." another said congress was "wasting time" worrying about it. one even said that efforts to guarantee fair pay reminded him of the soviet union.

and to that i say what century are they living in?

but thankfully the american people know the truth. and the truth is that when any parent is short-changed, the entire family is short-changed. and when families are short-changed, america is short-changed. and therefore this is not a women's issue this is a family issue and an american economic issue.

and here's what we should do instead to close the wage gap. first, we should pass the paycheck fairness act, which gives women the legal tools we need to fight discrimination at work.

i introduced this legislation in the senate back in 2005 and kept sponsoring it again and again. well it's time to get this done, once and for all.

second, we should promote pay transparency across our economy to ensure women have the information they need to negotiate fairly. you can't stand up for equal pay if you don't know whether you're paid equally. you remember the lilly ledbetter case, she didn't know for the longest that she wasn't being paid the same as her male coworkers doing the same jobs. postings for new jobs or promotions should come with salary ranges. large companies should report on how fairly, or not, they're compensating workers, male or female.

and we should applaud those businesses and communities that are leading the way with best practices and real accountability. i think transparency when it comes to pay is our friend. the more we can bring it out from under the table to put it on top, the more information we can have to advocate for ourselves and advocate for each other.

third, we need to raise wages for the lowest paid jobs in america -- which are, they are disproportionately held by women, especially women of color—we need to make it easier for more women to enter higher paying fields like science and engineering and technology. but i want to say something that a lot of people may not know even in this room full of activist and well informed democrats.

in most states today, waitresses, bartenders, hairstylists, and others who rely on tips are paid even lower than minimum wage.

some are paid as little as two dollars and thirteen cents an hour. and they are also more likely to face exploitation, wage theft, and sexual harassment. think about somebody you may know, think about the mom trying to succeed at work and give her kids the support they need with a job that pays her $2.13 an hour. and forces her to put up with some pretty awful behavior by clients or customers or bosses to try to get those tips to at least push it up to the federal minimum wage level.

and finally, we need workplace policies like paid leave and flexible scheduling that allow parents to take care of their obligations at home without sacrificing pay at work.

now, it's no secret that on equal pay and so many other issues, we're up against some pretty powerful forces, political and economic, that will do say and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for america. i'm here to tell you i'm not afraid to take them on.

you know i've spent my adult life going to bat for children, families, and our country.

and i do know how hard this job i'm seeking is. i have seen it up close and personal. you're not going to catch me wondering what it's like. instead i'm spending my time planning for what i will do for you when i get there.

all our presidents come into office looking so vigorous. think about what they look like on inauguration day and then we watch them they grow grayer and grayer, and by the time they leave they're as white as the building they live in.

well, let me tell you, i may not be the youngest candidate in this race. but i have one big advantage. i've been coloring my hair for years. so you're not going to see me turn white in the white house. and you're also not going to see me shrink from a fight. i think by now people know i don't quit.

so i hope you'll join me. i hope you'll help me build this campaign, make it your own. tell your friends to go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer.

this election is not about me. it's about us. and it has to be about what we will do together to restore faith, confidence and optimism in the future and the country we love.

i want to end with a story, some of you might remember we had a pretty vigorous campaign in 2008.

i vaguely recall. and both president obama and i worked really hard and he won and i lost and then i went to work to make sure he'd win. and i was so relieved, i was just so relieved when finally november 2008 came around and he did.

and then a few days after the election, my husband and i were taking a walk in a little forested area near where we live, and his phone went off, and he answered it, and it was the president-elect, who said, "bill, i need to talk to you, and i want to talk to hillary." and bill said, "well, we're in the middle of a forest, but as soon as we get home we'll call." so we did, and the president-elect talked to bill about the ideas he had and the cabinet and economic problems that he was all of a sudden being confronted with that he hadn't even been told about to the extent they were. so bill talked to him and then hands me the phone, and the president-elect says, "i want you to come to chicago to meet with me." and so i said, "certainly, when would you like me to come?" and he says, "as soon as you can come." and i thought he wanted to talk to me about what i would do in the senate to try to support what he was going to be championing as president.

so i went a few days later, go into this big office building and sit down with the president-elect, and he says to me, "i want you to be my secretary of state." and i said "well, mr. president-elect, i'm honored, i'm flattered, but there are so many other people," and i gave him names of people that i thought would have been great secretaries of state. and he says, "no, no, i have to spend all my time dealing with this economy, it's worse than we were even told, and yet we have all these problems around the world and i need somebody who i can send out there to go anywhere to talk to anyone, and i want it to be you." i said, "well, i can't tell you how moved i am, but i have to go back to the senate." and he said, "now, i don't want to hear from you until you say yes." so i go back to the airport and get on the plane. i go back to new york and i'm thinking, you know, the right thing for me is to stay in the senate, the people of new york had had a rough time. i became senator, and eight months later we had 9/11, and so i had spent most of my first term trying to help people and rebuild our city and protect it and everything and i just thought i needed to go back.

so i called the president-elect and said, "you know, again i cannot tell you how honored i am, and i will support you in any way i can, but i need to go back to the senate, and so i must say no, mr. president elect." he said, "i told you i didn't want to hear from you until you're ready to say yes." and so i say to my husband, you know, "can you believe this? i mean the president-elect has asked me to be secretary of state, i told him no twice, and he says he's not going to give up until i say yes." bill says, "well as i remember it, i asked you to marry me twice before you said yes. he said you might stop and think that maybe there is a pattern here." so i stayed up all night ,and i thought, you know, suppose it had been reversed, and i had been fortunate enough to win, and i wanted somebody to be in my cabinet that i knew i could rely on and i had asked the president-elect. i would have wanted him to say yes, because the country was facing some very serious decisions. so i called him back the next day, and i said "ok, mr. president, i am honored, i will be your secretary of state," and from that moment on we began to talk and to work together.

fast forward to my first trip i go to asia in february 2009, and i go because when i started calling presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. they all said we didn't know what to expect because nobody's been paying a lot of attention to us. and i said well that is going to change, because the president and i see asia as a very important priority, and i will come, so i was on my way.

one of the countries i was going to was indonesia, and i agreed to do both the private meetings with the leaders and press conferences, the kinds of things you see on tv, and to do a lot of what's called public diplomacy, where we would reach out to people, and we would basically say, we care about you we're back we want to work with you. let's try to find ways that we can be partners and send a different message.

so i agreed to go on this show in jakarta called the "awesome show." and it was the early morning show, and it was unlike anything i've even seen on our tv, and you know you see anything on our tv these days, people are jumping up and down, they're singing, they're dancing, and i'm sitting here thinking, "oh my gosh, i hope they don't ask me to sing or dance". but thankfully they didn't. they did an interview, and then they said the audience, "does anybody have any questions?" so somebody raised a hand and was called on. so this person said, "i want to ask you something. we followed your election." i found that people overseas followed our election, in some ways closer than some americans, really followed it, and so this questioner said, "we followed your election, it was really a hard, long-fought election" because as you know our elections last forever compared to most other countries which have elections. and he says, "we saw you and president obama going at it, he was saying bad things about you, you were saying back things about him, and then all of a sudden you end up as his secretary of state? how does that work?" and i thought, you know this is a really serious question, because in lots of places you run against somebody, you can be exiled, imprisoned, or killed, not made secretary of state, so i thought that there was a moment here that if i could rev my brain up that maybe could reach particularly young people because indonesia is a relatively young democracy. so i said, "you're right, we ran a very hard campaign against each other. he won, i lost, and then i went to work for him because he and i shared many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency and then he won and then he asked me to be secretary of state for the same reason, we both love our country."

and no matter how hard this election or any election becomes we should remember that at the core we can have disagreements, and we will, we have different governing philosophies, we have different views about what works, what the evidence shows works about economic policies, that's all fair game, but we should show more respect toward each other and we should remember why we're doing this, because we love our country, and we want it to be the country of hope and potential for our children and our grandchildren that many of us saw come into being over the last decades so as i run for president we're going to have some very difficult challenges. we'll have disagreements, we'll have debates, but i want you to know that i will be remembering what i think should be at the core of every political campaign, how we treat one another, and how we care for this gift we've been given, the united states of america. thank you very much.
wow! thank you so very much. i cannot tell you how personally honored i am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. let me start by thanking president rudley, everyone at texas southern university. it's a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from dr. rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. this institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of heman marion sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in houston, texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. i am delighted to be here with my friend, sheila jackson lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th district and state and the country.

i have to tell you though i thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of congress. and that is she is finally a member of the grandmother's club. and as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, sheila. i have to tell you i was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to barbara jordan and should be important to all of us. but to do so in front of dr. freeman is a little daunting. i mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to barbara jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. i noticed that both dr. rudley and dr. sheila both got off before dr. freeman came up.

i also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in houston and across texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. and i am confident that this community will embrace them. i remember very well coming here after katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young senator from illinois by the name of barack obama, along and with sheila and other leaders in the community. we toured the facilities that houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. and i saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. this is a city that knows how to pull together, and i'm confident you'll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster.

and it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that barbara jordan was succeeded by mickey leland and the 18th district was so well represented for so long, and i am delighted to be here with alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. so many issues that he was the champion of. and i want to thank rosemary mcgowan and all the friends and loved ones of barbara jordan here today. this is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroes—a woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.

i first met barbara jordan when i was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the house of representatives judiciary committee investigating richard nixon, and it was such a profound moment in american history. and there wasn't anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than barbara jordan.

as a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the thurgood marshall school here at tsu, i was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable congresswoman from texas. i got to talk with her, which was thrilling, i got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly i got to watch and listen to her.

at a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.

remember what she said: "my faith in the constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total."

it was that passion and moral clarity that took barbara jordan from the tsu and the halls of texas legislature all the ways to the halls of congress. the first woman and the first african american ever elected to represent texas in the house of representatives.

and she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of dr. martin luther king jr. and her friend and mentor president lyndon johnson—and in particular she was a staunch advocate for the voting rights act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.

in 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, barbara jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the voting rights act to many more americans, including hispanic americans, native americans, and asian americans as well.

and like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, i stand here on the shoulders of barbara jordan and so does our entire country.

and boy do we miss her. we miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.

i remember talking to her and ann richards one time. and between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. and they were telling me about how they would love to go to the university of texas women's basketball games. right, and barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and ann would be holding court right next to her. and barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. "why are you doing that? jump higher! that's not a pass!" you know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. and so ann was telling me this, with barbara right there and i finally turned to her and said, "barbara, encourage these young women, don't just criticize them." and barbara turned around and said, "when they deserve it, i will."

we sure could use her irresistible voice. i wish we could hear that voice one more time.

hear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after barbara jordan fought to extend the voting rights act, its heart has been ripped out.

and i wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. for the grandmother who's turned away from the polls because her driver's license expired. for the father who's done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn't gotten his rights back.

now we know, unfortunately, barbara isn't here to speak up for them and so many others. but we are. and we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what's really going on in our country—because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.

because since the supreme court eviscerated a key provision of the voting rights act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.

north carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. early voting. same-day registration. the ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.

now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?

we should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.

in fact i would say it is a cruel irony—but no coincidence—that millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in american history, are now facing so much exclusion.

and we need look no further than right here in texas. you all know this far better than i, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a valid form of identification—but a valid student id isn't good enough?

now, krystal watson found out the hard way. she grew up in louisiana but came to marshall, texas, to attend wiley college. krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. but this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a wiley college id, she was turned away.

experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in texas may face similar situations.

and while high-profile state laws like those in texas and north carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar. like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. or scrap language assistance for non-english speakers—something barbara jordan fought so hard for.

without the pre-clearance provisions of the voting rights act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.

it's not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. they are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines.

in south carolina, for example, there's supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. but in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. in richland country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.

now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. but this kind of disparity that i just mentioned does not happen by accident.

now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from arkansas, of course i learned it from him. "you find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own." well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. and it is just wrong, it's wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit americans' rights to vote. its counter to the values we share. and at a time when so many americans have lost trust in our political system, it's the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.

this is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. we should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.

yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental american principle.

here in texas, former governor rick perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. he applauded when the voting rights act was gutted, and said the lost protections were "outdated and unnecessary."

but governor perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.

in wisconsin, governor scott walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.

in new jersey, governor christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.

and in florida, when jeb bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.

thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.

so today, republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of american citizens from voting. what part of democracy are they afraid of?

i believe every citizen has the right to vote. and i believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.

i call on republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say.

yes, this is about democracy. but it's also about dignity. about the ability to stand up and say, yes, i am a citizen. i am an american. my voice counts. and no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. in fact, it means a lot.

i learned those lessons right here in texas, registering voters in south texas down in the valley in 1972.

some of the people i met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from chicago who didn't speak a word of spanish. but they wanted to vote. they were citizens. they knew they had a right to be heard. they wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. that's what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're all the worse for it. it doesn't just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. it holds back our entire country.

that's why, as a senator, i championed a bill called the count every vote act. if it had become law, it would have made election day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. and many americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back.

well today, with the damage to the voting rights act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.

first, congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that american voters need and deserve.

i was in the senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the voting rights act after an exhaustive review process.

there had been more than 20 hearings in the house and senate judiciary committees. testimony from expert witnesses. investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. there were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. now that is how the system is supposed to work. you gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. and we did 98 to nothing. we put principle ahead of politics. that is what congress needs to do again.

second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. that commission was chaired by president obama's campaign lawyer and by governor mitt romney campaign's lawyer. and they actually agreed. and they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. providing online voter registration. establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.

third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere—including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. if families coming out of church on sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. and we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on election day.

it's not just convenient—it's also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. so let's get this done.

and i believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in america. so today i am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. every citizen, every state in the union. everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18—unless they actively choose to opt out. but i believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. between a quarter and a third of all eligible americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.

and we should modernize our entire approach to registration. the current system is a relic from an earlier age. it relies on a blizzard of paper records and it's full of errors.

we can do better. we can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. when you move, your registration should move with you. if you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter—period.

now, oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. the technology is there. states have a lot of the data already. it's just a matter of syncing and streamlining.

now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. but i'll be candid here, none of them will come easily.

it's going to take leadership at many levels.

now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.

we need more activists working to expose abuses, educate americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. but they can't do it alone.

we need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the moral monday movement in north carolina to build momentum for reform.

we need more justices on the supreme court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, i mean the principle underlying our constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a supreme court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation.

but of course, you know what we really need? we need more elected leaders from houston to austin to washington who will follow in the footsteps of barbara jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. and we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.

you know, when i traveled around the world as your secretary of state, one of the most frequent questions i was asked was, "how could you and president obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?"

people were genuinely amazed, which i suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiled—even killed—not hired as secretary of state.

and it's true, i was surprised when the president asked me to serve. but he made that offer, and i accepted it, because we both love our country.

so my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that america was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. they were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.

as barbara jordan famously reminded us, when the constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. but generations of americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. they never gave up and never backed down.

and nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the united states.

so that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. and today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse america's long march toward a more perfect union.

we owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. to march just as far. to organize just as well. to speak out just as loudly. and to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.

that's what barbara jordan would do. that's what we should do in honor of her.

thank you, and may god bless you.
thank you! oh, thank you all! thank you so very, very much.

it is wonderful to be here with all of you.

to be in new york with my family, with so many friends, including many new yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the senate for eight years.

to be right across the water from the headquarters of the united nations, where i represented our country many times.

to be here in this beautiful park dedicated to franklin roosevelt's enduring vision of america, the nation we want to be.

and in a place... with absolutely no ceilings.

you know, president roosevelt's four freedoms are a testament to our nation's unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. his legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. one is the man i served as secretary of state, barack obama, and another is my husband, bill clinton.

two democrats guided by the — oh, that will make him so happy. they were and are two democrats guided by the fundamental american belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.

president roosevelt called on every american to do his or her part, and every american answered. he said there's no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous america: "equality of opportunity... jobs for those who can work... security for those who need it... the ending of special privilege for the few... the preservation of civil liberties for all... a wider and constantly rising standard of living."

that still sounds good to me.

it's america's basic bargain. if you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. and when everybody does their part, america gets ahead too.

that bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.

it's what kept my grandfather going to work in the same scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.

it's what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. and it did.

when president clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.

when president obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.

but, it's not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. we face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.

we're still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.

instead of an economy built by every american, for every american, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.

what happened?

well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. you know where we ended up.

except it wasn't the end.

as we have since our founding, americans made a new beginning.

you worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs... you figured out how to make it work. and now people are beginning to think about their future again — going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.

so we're standing again. but, we all know we're not yet running the way america should.

you see corporations making record profits, with ceos making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.

while many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of america's kindergarten teachers combined. and, often paying a lower tax rate.

so, you have to wonder: "when does my hard work pay off? when does my family get ahead?" "when?"

i say now.

prosperity can't be just for ceos and hedge fund managers.

democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations.

prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.

you brought our country back.

now it's time — your time to secure the gains and move ahead.

and, you know what?

america can't succeed unless you succeed.

that is why i am running for president of the united states.

here, on roosevelt island, i believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. each american and the country we cherish.

i'm running to make our economy work for you and for every american.

for the successful and the struggling.

for the innovators and inventors.

for those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.

for the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.

for the nurses who work the night shift.

for the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.

for the veterans who served our country.

for the small business owners who took a risk.

for everyone who's ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.

i'm not running for some americans, but for all americans.

our country's challenges didn't begin with the great recession and they won't end with the recovery.

for decades, americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.

advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of americans.

the financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value... too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.

our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. and they've lost trust in the ability of both government and big business to change course.

now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we've made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.

our next president must work with congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. and i will do just that — to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.

at our best, that's what americans do. we're problem solvers, not deniers. we don't hide from change, we harness it.

but we can't do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.

americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.

now, there may be some new voices in the presidential republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song...

a song called "yesterday."

you know the one — all our troubles look as though they're here to stay... and we need a place to hide away... they believe in yesterday.

and you're lucky i didn't try singing that, too, i'll tell you!

these republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.

we've heard this tune before. and we know how it turns out.

ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they'll say: "i'm not a scientist." well, then, why don't they start listening to those who are?

they pledge to wipe out tough rules on wall street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. in a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.

they want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million americans without offering any credible alternative.

they shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.

they want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.

and they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.

fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. it takes an inclusive society. what i once called "a village" that has a place for everyone.

now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for america.

i believe that success isn't measured by how much the wealthiest americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty...

how many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive...

how many young people go to college without drowning in debt...

how many people find a good job...

how many families get ahead and stay ahead.

i didn't learn this from politics. i learned it from my own family.

my mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. she knew what it was like not to have either one.

her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. years later, when i was old enough to understand, i asked what kept her going.

you know what her answer was? something very simple: kindness from someone who believed she mattered.

the 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.

the woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. that was a bargain she leapt to accept.

and, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.

that's why i believe with all my heart in america and in the potential of every american.

to meet every challenge.

to be resilient... no matter what the world throws at you.

to solve the toughest problems.

i believe we can do all these things because i've seen it happen.

as a young girl, i signed up at my methodist church to babysit the children of mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. and later, as a law student, i advocated for congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.

my first job out of law school was for the children's defense fund. i walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn't go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.

as a leader of the legal services corporation, i defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. and saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.

in arkansas, i supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.

as senator, i had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, emts, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.

it took years of effort, but congress finally approved the health care they needed.

there are so many faces and stories that i carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.

just weeks ago, i met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.

she doesn't expect anything to come easy. but she did ask me: what more can be done so it isn't quite so hard for families like hers?

i want to be her champion and your champion.

if you'll give me the chance, i'll wage and win four fights for you.

the first is to make the economy work for everyday americans, not just those at the top.

to make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. and to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.

the middle class needs more growth and more fairness. growth and fairness go together. for lasting prosperity, you can't have one without the other.

is this possible in today's world?

i believe it is or i wouldn't be standing here.

do i think it will be easy? of course not.

but, here's the good news: there are allies for change everywhere who know we can't stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of america dims. we should welcome the support of all americans who want to go forward together with us.

there are public officials who know americans need a better deal.

business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the lgbt community either.

there are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.

there are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow's economy. we need everyone to come to the table and work with us.

in the coming weeks, i'll propose specific policies to:

reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck — because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.

i will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.

i will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.

we will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.

we will restore america to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.

and we will make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.

developing renewable power — wind, solar, advanced biofuels...

building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings...

using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment...

and ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to indian country, from small towns in the mississippi delta to the rio grande valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow americans.

now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable america to lead the global fight against climate change.

we will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.

we will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.

now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.

that's why i will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in america.

and i want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. in fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.

one thing i've learned is that talent is universal — you can find it anywhere — but opportunity is not. too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.

our country won't be competitive or fair if we don't help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.

so let's staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.

let's make college affordable and available to all ...and lift the crushing burden of student debt.

let's provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more americans for success.

now, the second fight is to strengthen america's families, because when our families are strong, america is strong.

and today's families face new and unique pressures. parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.

i believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.

i believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.

i believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.

that you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.

i believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.

and it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color often making even less.

this isn't a women's issue. it's a family issue. just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. expanding childcare is a family issue. declining marriage rates is a family issue. the unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.

in america, every family should feel like they belong.

so we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. not second-class status.

and, we should ban discrimination against lgbt americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.

you know, america's diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what's drawn so many to our shores. what's inspired people all over the world. i know. i've seen it with my own eyes.

and these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.

so we have a third fight: to harness all of america's power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.

no other country on earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. no other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like russia, north korea, and iran — and to deal with the rise of new powers like china.

no other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like isis, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.

as your president, i'll do whatever it takes to keep americans safe.

and if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new world trade center soaring skyward.

as a senator from new york, i dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. and as a member of the armed services committee, i worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today's threats and tomorrow's.

and when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, i'll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they've earned.

i've stood up to adversaries like putin and reinforced allies like israel. i was in the situation room on the day we got bin laden.

but, i know — i know we have to be smart as well as strong.

meeting today's global challenges requires every element of america's power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.

there are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there's a lot of good news out there too.

i believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.

and we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. that's why we have to win the fourth fight — reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday americans.

we have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.

we need justices on the supreme court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, rather than every corporation's right to buy elections.

if necessary, i will support a constitutional amendment to undo the supreme court's decision in citizens united.

i want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. that's why i've proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.

i'll fight back against republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.

what part of democracy are they afraid of?

no matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give americans something worth voting for.

government is never going to have all the answers — but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.

that means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the american people.

we need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.

there's so much that works in america. for every problem we face, someone somewhere in america is solving it. silicon valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. i want to help washington catch up.

to do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.

now, i'll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. but i'll also stand my ground when i must.

that's something i did as senator and secretary of state — whether it was working with republicans to expand health care for children and for our national guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities — and it's something i will always do as your president.

we americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other's back.

like any family, our american family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.

people all over the world have asked me: "how could you and president obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?"

now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled — even killed — not hired as secretary of state.

but president obama asked me to serve, and i accepted because we both love our country. that's how we do it in america.

with that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.

we can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.

we can strengthen our families.

we can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.

and we can renew the promise of our democracy.

if we all do our part. in our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.

i want you to join me in this effort. help me build this campaign and make it your own.

talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.

text "join" to 4-7-2-4-6.

it's no secret that we're going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for america. but i've spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. and i'm not stopping now.

you know, i know how hard this job is. i've seen it up close and personal.

all our presidents come into office looking so vigorous. and then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.

well, i may not be the youngest candidate in this race. but i will be the youngest woman president in the history of the united states!

and the first grandmother as well.

and one additional advantage: you're won't see my hair turn white in the white house. i've been coloring it for years!

so i'm looking forward to a great debate among democrats, republicans, and independents. i'm not running to be a president only for those americans who already agree with me. i want to be a president for all americans.

and along the way, i'll just let you in on this little secret. i won't get everything right. lord knows i've made my share of mistakes. well, there's no shortage of people pointing them out!

and i certainly haven't won every battle i've fought. but leadership means perseverance and hard choices. you have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.

i think you know by now that i've been called many things by many people — "quitter" is not one of them.

like so much else in my life, i got this from my mother.

when i was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. in her later years, mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. i'd come home from a hard day at the senate or the state department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. and she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.

i can still hear her saying: "life's not about what happens to you, it's about what you do with what happens to you — so get back out there."

she lived to be 92 years old, and i often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century — all the progress that was won because americans refused to give up or back down.

she was born on june 4, 1919 — before women in america had the right to vote. but on that very day, after years of struggle, congress passed the constitutional amendment that would change that forever.

the story of america is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. and it continues today. new chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us — not just some, but all — should have the chance to live up to our god-given potential.

not only because we're a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we're a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single american.

i wish my mother could have been with us longer. i wish she could have seen chelsea become a mother herself. i wish she could have met charlotte.

i wish she could have seen the america we're going to build together.

an america, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.

where we don't leave anyone out, or anyone behind.

an america where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. even president of the united states.

thank you all. god bless you. and may god bless america.

thank you. oh, i am thrilled to be here, and to be in such a beautiful facility, having just had the chance to spend a little time with some children, mostly 4-year-olds, but a few 5-year-olds. it was great.

and i thank julie and the entire team here at the y. i am such a big believer in this kind of partnership, and i was thrilled, as julie was talking about it, to see the applause break out on behalf of this ymca and all that it does.

this is, for me, a very important place to be to talk about a really critical issue, one that, as julie has said, i have spent much of my adult life being committed to and concerned about, and i can't think of a better place to do this than here in new hampshire, a state that will always have a special place in my heart.

and so, i had a great event saturday in a perfect place on a perfect day, on roosevelt island in new york city at the four freedoms park that was constructed in honor of president roosevelt. and i was able to talk about the four fights that i want to wage and win on behalf of the american people.

they, to me, really encapsulate what my campaign is about, but also what our country needs to do together, build an economy for tomorrow, not yesterday; strengthen america's families, because when our families are strong, america is strong; harness all of our power, not just the military but diplomatic and economic to use our values to lead the world; and to revitalize our democracy here at home, particularly by focusing on getting dark, unaccountable money out of politics, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.

and i will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come, but i do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them, taking care of their needs, being able to stimulate them, to give them a better chance in life, helping them become successful and good citizens.

and, for me, all of this does come back to our kids. and that's because my mother, who was with me in new hampshire in 2008, really taught me that everybody needs a chance and everybody needs a champion. and for...

for her, she knew what it was like not to have either when she was growing up, because she was abandoned very young by her parents and sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her, so that by the time she was 14, she was out on her own, working as a house maid and a babysitter, in another family's home.

and i didn't know any of this when i was growing up. when i was the age of the kids we were reading "the very hungry caterpillar" to, i just knew she was my mom. and she was great and she was fun, and she taught me so much. and she made grilled cheese and tomato soup sandwiches. i mean, there was just a wonderful sense of being loved and taken care of, but also being inspired.

and i remember asking her when i got old enough to kind of piece together some of the answers to questions i was getting about her childhood, how could she do this?

and her answer was very simple, you know, kindness along the way from people that cared about her and showed her she mattered. the first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat for lunch, and without embarrassing here, started bringing extra food, and then would lean over and whisper, "dorothy, i brought too much food today. would you like some? i can't eat it all."

or even the woman whose house she went to work in, she wanted so much to go to high school, but she knew she had to do the chores that were necessary. and so the woman said, "well, if you can get your chores done, you can go to high school." and that was a great gift that my mother was forever grateful for.

because those people believed in her, she believed in me. you know, there is a direct link. if we believe in our children, we instill in them the belief that they are worth something. and then they, in turn, can pass that on.

now, ideally we all hope that families can do that. but in today's world, it's really hard for many families to do everything they're expected to do under the stresses that they face. because of her, i believe in the potential of every american, and particularly every american child. and when our children succeed, america succeeds.

so, i've been a champion for early childhood education for as long as i can remember, really starting when i was in law school and got interested in, as i was studying the law, why do some people follow the law and other people don't. what's—what's in their background? what makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up?

and that's why i'm putting this front and center in my campaign, because i think it's time we realized once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make.

now, i think most of us kind of intuitively have known that. but now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact life-long success. so we have to help parents be their children's first teachers, from that very first day. and we have to help them get access to quality, affordable childcare and preschool.

and for me, it's recognizing the reality of today's families: 40 percent of the breadwinners, the principle breadwinners in america today are women. we have a lot of single moms heroically trying to raise kids under sometimes very challenging circumstances. we have a lot of two-parent families where people are working night shifts. they're overlapping. they are just doing everything they can sometimes with multiple jobs to keep body and soul together and put that food on the table and that roof over their head.

today's parents have to juggle so much. they have to squeeze every minute out of every 24-hour day. and that just makes the argument even stronger as to why we have to have their backs. we have to be there to help them do the best job they can possibly do.

yes, they need to do the job that pays them. but at the end of the day, the job raising children, taking care of your family, caring even for your parents as they age, is the most important job any of us will ever do. and we don't do it for pay. we do it for love. we do it for a sense of giving back. but let's try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier.

you know, i met a woman...

you know, i met a woman a few weeks—a couple weeks ago who was trying to do everything she could imagine to make it work. she was a single mom. she's raising three kids. she was working, and she was going to community college, because she was trying to get ahead so that she could get a better job.

she said, "you know, i don't ask for anything, but why does it have to be so hard"? i hear that question all over. "why does it have to be so hard"?

it's hard enough to pay for any preschool or childcare at all, let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish. funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. so it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent the past decade.

in many states, it costs more for childcare of quality than it costs for college tuition, and we know what's happened at that end of the learning curve.

we actually did make a lot of progress expanding preschool attendance for 3-and 4-year-olds during the 1990s. i was honored to hold the first ever white house conference on early childhood development to bring together people, like those you see here.

but starting in 2001, there's been almost no progress. only 55 percent of all of america's 3-and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool, and meanwhile, many of our economic competitors are racing ahead. they are making big investments in preschool and early education.

i'll tell you a little story. you know, i spent a lot of time as secretary of state trying to figure out how we were going to deal with the rise of china. it's going to be one of the biggest problems for the next president. and there're a lot of aspects to it.

but i was not surprised to get a call about two years ago shortly, after i left the state department, on behalf of the highest-ranking woman in the chinese government. and she was coming to washington, and i had worked with her as secretary of state, and she asked if she could see me, and i said, "of course. i'd be happy to see her."

and then she said, "you know, could you do an event with me about early childhood"? i said, "oh, certainly. what is it about early childhood that has you so interested"?

here's what she said, and then we did the event. we did the event at the brookings institute in washington.

china's making a huge commitment to early childhood and to pre-kindergarten. why? they look at the same brain research.

in fact, they have asked the american nobel prize-winning economist from the university of chicago, hardly a hotbed of radical liberalism...  ... to be their consultant, among others, because he did the study, which proved that early-childhood investing by a country is one of the best returns on investment that we can make. so the chinese are using an american expert for that.

though, if i hadn't been excited before, i got really motivated about this. but unfortunately, we're hearing something different from republican leaders in washington.

republicans aren't just missing the boat on early-childhood education; they're trying to sink it. their budget puts at risk on the most effective investments for our youngest children, early head start.

did they cut subsidies to oil companies? no. did they cut tax loopholes, like carried interest for hedge-fund managers? no.

the republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids.

now i believe getting off to a good start should be our children's birthright, part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation.

every child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow's economy, especially those kids from our most vulnerable and at-risk communities. and we need to make sure that parents can get good jobs and stay in the workforce. that drives the economic engine. so we have to do more to help them deal with the most difficult of the decisions of parents for young children to stay in the workforce.

i believe the time has come to make pre-school and quality child care available to every child in america. if our families are going to be strong and our economy is going to thrive, all our kids need the chance to get off to the best possible start.

i will i will work with states and communities across america to make sure that in the next 10 years, every four-year-old in america has access to high-quality pre-school. now already governors and state legislatures across the country are discovering the value of pre-school and this is bipartisan.

you know, one of the states with a universal pre-k program in america is oklahoma—about as red a state as you can get. but they have figured it out, the government and business leaders and families alike that this is a smart investment for them. and we have to build on the momentum started by the states. now look how far here in new hampshire you've come.

nearly 20 years ago, back when senator jeanne shaheen was governor shaheen, she delivered funding for public kindergarten for the first time in the state's history.

that then allowed the conversation to move where it is today with governor maggie hassan supporting efforts for full-day kindergarten and innovative pre-k partnerships. so you start and get what you...  ... have achieved on kindergarten. then you move toward full day and then innovative pre-k.

all across the country we need to be doing that. and we also need to invest in child care because, if you only start at four, the brain research shows that 80 percent of your brain has developed by the age of three. now the good news is that leaves 20 percent to keep working on.

but it is a fact that, by three, many of our kids have already had most of the brain development that they're going to get. and in this campaign, i'll offer a comprehensive agenda to ensure that every child in america has access to quality affordable child care.

i will propose a middle-class tax cut to help parents deal with rising child care costs.

and i'll lead an effort to expand child care opportunities and to make sure that programs address both the needs of working parents and the needs of children.

we shouldn't think of child care as just a place to deposit your kids, a warehouse. we should invest in programs that create health environments for early learning and to make sure that parents get the support they need from the time their children are infants. i will double the early head start child care partnership grant program, which brings head start's evidenced-based curriculum into the child care setting to provide comprehensive, full-day, high-quality services to low-income families. and i will double our investment in early head start itself, a program i helped to create when i was first lady. and we know...

we know it's making a difference, because we actually have evidence that shows it's making a difference.

and this is part, as i said, of a long-term commitment of mine, going back to my methodist church, where i was—i was raised, and babysitting, you know, children of mexican migrant farmworkers, through my years at the children's defense fund, working to expand opportunities for kids with disabilities, and through my time in the white house with my husband and in the senate in new york and even as secretary of state, because i have learned that talent is universal, but opportunity is not. and i look sometimes...

i look sometimes in the eyes of kids who've had a really tough set of obstacles to overcome, and they're doing the best they can. and we need to do what we can to help them succeed.

but every baby comes into this world with so much god-given potential. and when they leave the hospital, some will have great opportunity their family can give them, and others will struggle.

now, as you may have heard, i am a new grandmother. and so, for me...  ... this has become really personal. i remember being in the hospital waiting for charlotte's arrival and talking to the nurses there. and what did they want to talk to me about? they wanted to talk to me about how hard it was for them, plus a lot of their patients, to get childcare. how it was especially hard when they had to work the night shift. how they has to keep juggling everything, all the time. and it was here, at one of the great moments in my life, a reminder that there are so many hardworking, conscientious people, who deserve more help than they're getting right now.

and it needs to be a partnership, just like this y is a partnership. you know, a partnership between the public and private interests. a partnership where people feel that they can contribute and participate.

i think if we come together and take this on as a true national mission, we can unlock the potential of all our children and further the potential of our country.

and our country then will be more inclusive, not leaving people behind and out, and where a father can tell his daughter, "you can grow up to be anything you want, including president of the united states."

 well, how do you do? how do you do?

i'm jackie cowell , and like many of you i'm looking around the audience and i'm seeing many of you that like me have been working on this for 20 or 30 years. so thank you for your perseverance on early childhood education out there, you know.

and the children that you met this morning are likely to graduate from high school in 2030. so just think about what 2030 is going to be looking like.

when i was in high school, our class took a field trip to see a computer. i don't...  ... i don't think they do that anymore, but...  ... but it's really going to be—they're likely to retire in the 2080s. so how do you prepare them for this very complex world they're going to inherit? and many of them will hold jobs that haven't been invented yet. so it's really working on these skills, as you talked about—early childhood education. and we're thrilled that this discourse is now part of the presidential primary; that early childhood education is being talked about; and making sure ever child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

and, you know, here in new hampshire, things have been tough for families, trying to make ends meet, trying to make sure they can get into childcare that is quality, that really helps them reach their full potential. and there's too many families that aren't able to do that because of the difference of the cost.

so, yeah.

 well, you know, jackie , i think that's a great perspective to put on it because when we talk about early childhood, we think about the little kids like the ones that we were with in the classroom.

but we ought to have a broader perspective and think about the adults they will become. and what kind of adults do we need? we need people who will have exactly the skills for jobs that haven't been invented, and will have the temperament and the character and the attributes to, you know, get along with people, to respect the law, respect each other, to be part of building a stronger, more prosperous america.

and i think it's a great perspective if you kind of work backwards and you say to yourself, "ok, what are you going to look for in somebody who wants to be a worker and a citizen in 15, 20, 30 years?" you know that that really starts so importantly at the beginning.

 thank you so much for being here this morning and for this discussion.

i'm mary lou beaver from rochester. i'm not here this morning representing an organization, but as someone who was in the field for more than 25 years as a teacher, as a center director, and as a center owner here in rochester.

i also was a mom, who was dependent upon childcare for my children as i suddenly found myself a single mom, and was in school trying to continue my education so that i could do more and provide more for my family. having quality childcare education, early education for my kids was so important to me because i was in and out so much of the time when i really wanted to be spending time with them, and wanted to give them all that i could.

but as so many parents today are facing, you need to work the hours that you have to work in order to support your family. and it's very important that we have not only the accessibility and the quality, but the affordability for all families.

do you agree?

 oh, i do agree. and i think your story is really important for everybody to hear because that is the reality that is going on right now. i—i just meet so many working parents, particularly single working moms who are struggling. they're really working as hard as they can, as you were, and many of them trying to go to school at the same time because they know they'll have a better future if they do.

i remember when i was teaching law at the university of arkansas, oh gosh, back in the early 1970s, i met so many people around the campus who were single parents, trying to go to school. and childcare was their biggest obstacle. and we, you know, we started a fund called the arkansas single parent scholarship fund, because it wasn't the money that they needed so much for the tuition, although that was a stretch, it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education.

and i think you have to look at what young families are going through today in a very comprehensive way and say, ok, what can the extended family do? what can the—you know, houses of worship, our churches, do? what can communities do? what can the y do? or you know, the boys & girls club?

there's so many different ways to kind of piece this together, but there isn't any way to get to a universal program, unless our government in washington sees it as a priority to partner with many of the states and localities—we have the mayor here; thank you for being here, mayor—so that we can provide the backstop and the support that is necessary.

and it's particularly important for the youngest kids, the zero to three kids, because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention. you know, bill and i are exhausted every time we take care of charlotte.

we love every minute of it, but whew. it reminds you hard it is to raise babies and to keep an eye on them, as they, you know, take off on their own. so i think it is important that we do everything we can to deal with that zero-to-three age group. and that's going to take more direction. that's why i mentioned early head start child care partnership and the early head start program.

but again, we need more people to help fill that space because that's often where parents really are stretched, and we also don't have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents and so, just getting everything organized, when you have that new baby is a challenge, don't you think?

 absolutely. as a grandmother, i can certainly relate to the exhaustion.  the other concern that i had as a center director was the wages that we were able to pay to our educators. we know that consistent, quality educators are so important to young children, as they are growing and learning. but we can't always keep them, because of the wages that are paid.

 well, that's why i said i'm going to offer a middle-class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality child care, because you've put your finger on one the biggest problems. a lot of parents cannot afford quality child care. and a lot of the teachers and the child care workers can't afford to live on what the parents can pay.

so you have a perfect storm where we need quality child care, but how are we going to get the people with the continuity so that the experience is there to be able to deliver that child care. when parents can't go any further, they're stretched as far as they can get.

and i have been meeting with child care workers. and a lot of them just throw up their hands. they'd rather go be a food server for the money, but not for the, you know, reward that they have gotten from taking care of kids. they just—i mean, they're making $8, $9, $10 an hour for often 12-hour days. and that is just a huge burden on them and their family. so then, you have a downward spiral. is that what you've seen, too?

 it is. there's a saying that: parent's can't afford to pay; teachers can't afford to stay; there's got to be a better way. and so...

unknown: that's good.

 right—it's the worthy wage campaign, is—that's their saying.

and so here in new hampshire, we've actually with the department of education, department of health and human services and our governor's office applied for two federal grants, hoping to really show what we could do in early childhood education. so the race to the top—early learning challenge grant and the preschool development grant, and we didn't get them. and one of the reasons, we're the only new england state that didn't get the race to the top grant, because we've been divesting instead of investing.

and so what we found also, talking with business leaders, that this is not a red or a blue issue, that people really genuinely care about making sure every child has that opportunity.

so here in new hampshire, we're really seeing that starting to—to come—but we haven't gotten those grants, and we'd like to.

 well, i want to throw it open for—i know there're a lot of people in this audience who care deeply about this issue, have their own experience in doing the issue.

and so julia, i think we should see if somebody else wants to contribute to the conversation.

moderator: do we have any questions from the audience? right here in the pattern?

 hi.

 there is—there is...

moderator: there is a microphone coming.

 there's a roving microphone.

 oh. thank you.

my daughter—my granddaughter is here. what are you going to do for the—the grandparents that are raising these children? my generation, all of my friends are raising their grandchildren.

 can i ask you without—i don't want to impinge on your—your privacy. what are the circumstances under which you're raising your grandchildren ?

 it was——they're going to be turned over to the state because of addiction.

 so, you know, i have to tell you, this is—thank you. thank you. i'm so, so sorry. but you are the second grandmother in new hampshire who's said that to me.

and that's one of the reasons why if you followed my campaign—because of what i've been hearing, because i have spent two months listening to people, because i do think it's important, when you want to represent the entire country, you actually listen to what's happening in people's lives. and substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country.

and i heard it first in iowa and then as soon as i got to new hampshire—i was sitting down in keene, new hampshire talking to some people. first thing a retired doctor said, "what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic in new hampshire"?

first of all, i'm going to talk a lot about it, because we need to drag it out of shadows. we need to hold it up to the light.

and—and—and then it's heartbreaking, because there has not been an event i've got to, where somebody hasn't come up to me, sometimes bravely, like you did in public, and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it.

that and mental-health problems that go untreated and...

so i would say three things.

first, i think you're very brave and very loving to take on this responsibility, and you should know that every time...  ... you think about how hard it is, and you're grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said, "i'm here for you, and i will take care of you."

secondly, we have to—we have to extend every program, every tax—everything we do to people taking care of kids, whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe, in some cases, older siblings or aunts or uncles, because of the inability of a child's parents to be able to do so.

so whatever i propose, you will be eligible for, people who are taking care of their grandchildren.

yes. yes.

right now, you can't get any help in most places. and we have to change that. we have to face the reality. i mean, when you're—look, i just --we were just laughing about, you know, my eight-month old is beginning, you know, heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl. but once she takes off and we're chasing her around, and trying to keep her hands out of the outlets and all the things that you have to do with little kids, grandparents who are raising their kids, and there are millions of them, need more help.

you know, when i was a senator, i championed a program in new york city to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids, because they needed, in my view, the support of a community. because it can be really isolating. i mean, most of your friends, you know, they're not raising babies, toddlers or school-age kids, so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that, and you need the support that any parent would get, because that's what you're doing, you're parenting.

so i can tell you that i will do everything i can, both in any benefit that i think the country should extend to raising children, you will be eligible, but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers, because it's predominantly grandmothers. there are some grandfathers, predominantly grandmothers too.
well, this is one of the—you know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently.

you know, some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher's lessons. some kids need to move. some kids need to have practical experience. and i do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning. and i don't think that...

i don't think that works for every kid. and especially for kids who are hyperactive, kids who, you know, need to be channeled and directed, but also need to be able to, you know, get rid of some of that extra energy that they've got.

i mean, i don't know how you—i don't know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extracurricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons you're trying to teach.

so, the specific issue about adhd kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids. and i think we have to ask ourselves: are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated? and the answer is yes, some do, no doubt about it. but are we medicating kids because we've not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs?

and that starts in the family, because it, you know, it's hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools.

so i—i—part of what i will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to...  ... help kids. and, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. and i don't think a cookie-cutter approach works. i want every kid to do well in school. i want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. i think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education.

i think, you know, there are—we're going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work. it is work that, you know, they learn to do by doing. and then—i was, you know, i was in a community college, you knew, new hampshire technical institute, talking to the people there. and the—there were students who were taking courses, who were in high school. that's one way of doing it, having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if they're interested.

i went to one in iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists. they were juniors and seniors in high school. and the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist.

well, we need to make that available for more kids. and, look, i'm not a scientist.

but unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side, i actually listen to scientists.

and one of the things that...  ... one of the things that i will try to do, with a—by partnering, you know, not by mandating and directing, but partnering with our educators, partnering with people who have experience like our folks here, is to figure out: ok, how do we get more hands-on learning? because i do believe that for kids, especially adhd kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that's their interest.

so we're going to take a hard look at all of that. but it's—you know, education is a local and state matter, but i think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have.

well, you know, education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility. and it really wasn't until, you know, 30, 40 years ago, really, i guess back in the 1960s, when the government began to put in a lot more money from the federal government into education.

and the original idea behind the federal government putting money in was to try to equalize spending, so that, you know, kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that, which i think is still very important, so that it was an equity argument—some of you know, title 1, in the elementary and secondary education act—was really designed to do that.

then in the reagan administration, i think it was 19—i want to remember here—'83 or so. there was a report that came out called "a nation at risk." and it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly europeans, some asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they're not performing. and that was really a big change.

the reagan administration began saying, ok, well, the federal government has to do more to try to change the way we're educating. and that went on. and certainly, president george w. bush with no child left behind, it was certainly well-motivated. i was in the senate. i know the arguments that were made. and it was to try to, you know, create a system where, no matter who you were, where you went to school, you'd have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve.

and i say all of this because we've always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who's in and who's out, greater or lesser amounts. but always the biggest part of the budget, other than social security, medicare, et cetera.

so i think that your question is a fair one, like, what are our priorities? we will always have to have the—you know, the strongest, best-equipped military. but even there we have to save money. we have to be smart about it. we have to look for ways to get more done efficiently.

and just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don't just send money, without getting the results that we need. and there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas around—you know, military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up, streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality.

so i think that it's time in our country—and in my speech on saturday, i said we have to  our government. we have to take a hard look at everything. we have to bring it into the 21st century. now our military equipment is 22nd century. i mean, it's more advanced than anybody, anywhere.

but we're also fighting wars where a lot of what we've paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable. i mean, we're dealing with different kinds of threats. we're dealing with cyber threats. we're dealing with, you know, irregular warfare and terrorism. so we've got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it. to the extend that we need to get the outcomes we're looking for.

but on education, we've put more federal dollars in. but to go back to the question about adhd, we need to take a hard look about what's working and what's not working. i just want to give you a—and i'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. but i want to give you a quick understanding of what i mean.

you know, everybody believes, and i'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school.

and those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out. we know what worked or didn't work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won't work for other people.

look, there's a lot of truth to that. people's—your experience matters. and how you experienced school matters.

but i think research really counts. so, there's a team of researchers i know—you know, they're based at harvard, but other schools have been involved. and they went through all of the work that's been done. they said, ok, what makes for a great school?

and they came out with some things that are simple, but hard to do and hard to pay for, you know, things like a longer school year, particularly for disadvantaged kids. we have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences. maybe they go to the y camp. i was talking to, you know, one of he people where who runs the camps. maybe they—maybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums.

but for a lot of kids, they actually lose learning over the summer. so here the teachers have worked and worked, and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances, then they lose ground, so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year.

so a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense. a longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble. and all kinds of trouble and bad influences.

well, you know, the parents are working. oftentimes, again, they have no options, so longer day, longer school day.

more support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other. now, that sounds so simple, but it is so critical. like, ok, what worked in your classroom? you know, i tried this lesson, it didn't work, let's take another look at it.

and what we've done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of them all of these tests and all of these standards.

i believe in both, always have, but you can get to a point of diminishing returns. too many and really all you're doing is like running on the hamster wheel, instead of figuring out what does this kid need? what's the diagnosis for this kid's problem? how do we deal with it? and then finally let's not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school. so having more interaction between the school and the home, even if it's a phone call, even if it's an e-mail exchange, even better if it's regular visits. because if parents don't understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don't reinforce it, it's really hard for teachers to make that case.

so i think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. and i'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. they don't have sports teams anymore. they don't have bands. they don't have plays. they don't have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success.

and so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, "you've got to do well on these tests" that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well. but if you give them more options, more responsibility and more support for those places that need it, then, i think, we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically.

so that's what i want to see us do more of, so
well, you make a great point. if people are really interested in following up on the points that she made, we don't compare ourselves to china, but it is stressing to me when china invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we don't. because if you look at the highest-performing nations, finland is usually at the top.

they have early childhood education. they have paid leave. they have support for families. and yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. they've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively.

and if you look at the other countries—the best comparisons are to what are called the oecd countries, if you're interested in googling that and looking. they do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what's working and what's not working.

and i absolutely agree that, you know, creativity, you cannot expect kids to be creative if you don't let them play. now, playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be, in kindergarten it should be.

that doesn't mean they can't be learning at the same time. and that—and this debate that we're having seems to me to be so beside the point. it's not like either play or learn. through play that is supervised in preschool, you will learn if it's done right. that's why we want quality preschool. right? and so it's a way of unleashing creativity and allowing, you know, little kids' personalities to develop.

i just—in the classroom where i just was, i was handed this book of drawings. each of the kids did a drawing about what they want to be when they grow up. and, you know, they want to be a firefighter. they want to be an artist. they want to be a vet. they want to be a hair stylist. i mean, it was everything you could imagine, but that's the beginning of them thinking about envisioning adulthood.

so the teachers here, they look at that, and they—and they—you know, they'll talk about what it would mean to be a vet. or gee, why do you want to be a hair stylist? what does that mean to you? what kind of artist do you want to be? that is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom.

and so i think that the reaction against all the testing is coming from people who believe that we have to—we have to hold accountable what happens in our school. we can't just say it doesn't matter whether kids learn anything. that's not acceptable.

but we have to get back to thinking about the different ways kids learn, and creativity—the best gift you can give a child is a creative, open, learning mind that will enable that child to pursue his or her own dreams to live up to his or her own god-given potential.

and that potential may...  ... may not at all be the same by anybody else's.

so i want to—i want to give our two guests, if i can, the chance for the last word, because they—they've been on the front lines.
thank you. thank you so much. thank you very much, president van zant, and thanks to everyone at the new school for welcoming us today. i'm delighted to be back.

you know, over the past few months, i have had the opportunity to listen to americans' concerns about an economy that still isn't delivering for them. it's not delivering the way that it should. it still seems, to most americans that i have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top.

but i've also heard about the hopes that people have for their future—going to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they've always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement.

previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. and when you get ahead, america gets ahead. but over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. our job is to make it strong again.

for 35 years, republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working americans.

twice now in the past 20 years, a democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind.

i think the results speak for themselves. under president clinton—i like the sound of that—america saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history.

nearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. eight years later, president obama and the american people's hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. president obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to 16 million americans.

now today—today, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus, i believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. you can't have one without the other.  we can't create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can't build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. we need both.

because while america standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. corporate profits are at near record highs and americans are working as hard as ever. but paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages.

i hear this everywhere i go. a single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. she doesn't expect anything to come easy. but if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard.

the grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people's kids. she's proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs.

the young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. if he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too.

millions of hardworking americans tell similar stories. wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. the defining economic challenge of our time clear. we must raise incomes for hard-working americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. we must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. and that...

and that will be my mission, from the first day i am president to the last. i...

i will get up every day thinking about the families of america, like the family i came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle-class life. i will be thinking about all the people that i represented in new york and the stories that they told me, and that i worked with them to improve. i will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the recession and will not end with the recovery.

you know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of americans.

today's marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. meanwhile, many americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. this on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.

but it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.

so, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. but they do not determine our destiny. the choices we make as a nation matter.  and the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century.

as president, i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the american middle class. because i think at our best, that's what americans do. we are problem solvers, not deniers. we don't hide from change; we harness it.

the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful ceos and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people's lives and livelihoods.

i want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. we're not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can't go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.

today is not 1993. it's not 2009. so we need solutions for the big challenges we face now.

so today, i'm proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth.

let me begin with strong growth. more growth means more jobs and more new businesses. more jobs give people choices about where to work.

and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. that's why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes.

small businesses create more than 60 percent of new american jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. i've said i want to be the small-business president, and i mean it. and throughout this campaign, i'm going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification.

i'll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas.

and i know it's not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform.

i want you to hear this. bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years.

then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs.

you know, when we get americans moving, we get our country moving. so let's establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds...  ... channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports.

and let's built those faster broadband networks and make sure there's a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice.

and really, there's no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now.

our economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make america the clean-energy superpower.  i advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change.

and let's fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and president obama's initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years.

i will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.

but today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women.

we are in a global competition, as i'm sure you have noticed. and we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. but that's exactly what we're doing today. when we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.

the movement of women into the american workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. but that progress has stalled.

the united states used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women's labor force participation. by 2013, we had dropped to 19th. that represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for american families.

studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they're expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not.

we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they're going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick.

you know, last year—  —last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan, waiting for little charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. and we began to talk about it. she sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of.

it's time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. it's a growth strategy. and it's way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less.

you know, all this lost money adds up. and for some women, it's thousands of dollars every year. now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women's issues. well, those days are over.

fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. and we can do this in a way that doesn't impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses.  as president, i'll fight to put families first, just like i have my entire career.

now beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes.  the evidence is in. inequality is a drag on our entire economy. so this is the problem we need to tackle. now, you may have heard governor bush say americans just need to work longer hours. well, he must not have met very many american workers.

let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. they do not need a lecture. they need a raise.

the truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. to get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. if you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. so, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement president obama's new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further.

i will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis-classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. to make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. i will protect the affordable care act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs.

and to make prescription drugs more affordable. we will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future. now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. we need new ideas, as well, and one i believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. hard-working americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce.

so, i will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. that is good for workers and good businesses. studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company's success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees' pockets. it's a win-win. later this week in new hampshire, i will have more to say about how we do this.

another priority must be reforming our tax code. now, we hear republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. but take a good look at their plans. senator rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.

well, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that's the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. i have a different take...  ... guided license principles. first, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. that's why i support the buffet rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. i have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate.

and let's agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that america has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can't afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more.

alongside tax reform, it's time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. republican governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers' rights, and practically all the republican candidates hope to do the same as president. i will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. evidence—  —evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers.

and let me just say a word here about trade. the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities.

so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. we should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. and we should be prepared to walk away if they don't. to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans.

i love the saying by abraham lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. he talked about giving americans a fair chance in the race of life. i believe that with all my heart, but i also believe it has to start really early, at birth.

high quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. and—  —and i'm committed to seeing every 4-year-old in america have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. but i want to do more. i want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group.

eighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. that's why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. i've said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing.

but we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, i'll admit, it's embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it's building her capacity for learning. and the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background.

think of what we are losing because we're not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the united states and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start.

we also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, i will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt.

and let's embrace—  —let's embrace the idea of lifelong learning. in an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs.

there are exciting efforts underway and i want to support and scale the ones that show results.

as we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to indian country.

talent is universal; you find it everywhere. but opportunity is not. there are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in america today who are not in school or at work. the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering.

a quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all latino youth cannot find a job. we've got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class.

i firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that's hard to say if there aren't enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty.

that's why ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. when—  —when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country's prosperity, that's fair growth. it's what i've always believed in and it's what i will fight for as president.

now the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. many business leaders see this. they've talked to me about it.

one has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. they say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent.

net business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy.

in recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. that doesn't leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company's future success.

these trends need to change. and i believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today's share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet.

now i'm not talking about charity; i'm talking about clear-eyed capitalism. many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits.

now it's easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but i would argue that's bad for business in the long run and it's really bad for our country.

workers are assets. investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. training pays off. to help more companies do that, i proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire.  and i will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades.

i will also propose reforms to help ceos and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day.

making sure stock buybacks aren't being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. and nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on wall street.

as a former senator from new york, i know firsthand the role that wall street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make america more competitive globally.

but as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in washington either could not or would not keep up. i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.

under president obama's leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on wall street. those rules have been under assault by republicans in congress and those running for president. i will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. we can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust.

we also have to go beyond dodd-frank. too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. and the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non-bank finance companies. so many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all.

stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. there can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior.

and while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. this is wrong, and on my watch it will change. over the course...  ... over the course of this campaign, i will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on wall street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. i will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. we will ensure...

we will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. and we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing.

when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. it could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers.

now, reform is never easy, but we've done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time.  and yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us.

two years ago, the head of the chicago mercantile exchange, terry duffy, published an op-ed in the wall street journal that really caught my attention.

he wrote, and i quote, "i'm concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. some wall streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the main street," unquote.

i think we should listen to terry duffy. of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well.

so it's time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. it's time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we're going to tackle the big stuff together.

how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? what are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like silicon valley?

questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of america perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing.

so government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. washington has to be a better steward of america's tax dollars and americans' trust. and please, let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology.

that's what i'll do as president. i will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality.

i want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and i will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits.

i will make sure washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across america.

you know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. as president, i will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country.

i confess, maybe it's the grandmother in me, but i believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit, and the vision i've laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. that is the test of our time.

and i'm inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. that's what great countries do. that's what our country always has done. we rise to challenges. it's not about left, right or center; it's about the future versus the past.

i'm running for president to build an america for tomorrow, not yesterday, an america built on growth and fairness, an america where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don't leave anyone behind.

thank you all. thank you. i just want to leave you with one more thought. i want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her god-given potential. please join me in that mission—let's do it together.
i also want to thank jan for reminding us that today is the 25th anniversary of the americans with disabilities act. and i am thrilled to see the progress – she talked about some of the barriers that she faced when she came here to go to college, and how a lot of those barriers have been broken down and eliminated. what she didn't say is that in addition to the leadership tom harkin showed in getting the ada passed, jan was a strong voice in favor of that as well and an incredible witness for what it would mean.

i think that we should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country. i remember my first job out of law school was with the children's defense fund. i didn't want to go work for a law firm. i wanted to go to work to be an advocate, and i joined the organization started by marian wright edelman, an incredible woman lawyer, african-american, first ever to pass – and be acknowledged as passing – the mississippi state bar, and marian started the children's defense fund. when i joined, our first project in the summer of 1973 was to go door to door along with others across our country to gather evidence about why so many american children were not in school. we suspected that one of the biggest reasons was that their disabilities were not accommodated in school, and therefore they could not attend school. but we didn't know that for sure, and we wanted to find out. so i went door-to-door in new bedford, massachusetts, saying, "do you have a school-aged child who's not in school?" and i heard, yes, you know, our daughter dropped out to take care of the younger kids, or our son dropped out to go to work to help support the family. but i heard mostly that, yes, we have a blind child, a deaf child, a child in a wheelchair, a child with some other kind of disability that is not accepted in school. so we gathered up all of our evidence, and we presented it to the congress, and that first effort resulted in passing education for all, and all children with disabilities were given the right to go to school. that was a huge step forward for our country.

and then the effort began with real conviction to try to expand the rights that people with disabilities should have in our society. tom harkin, ted kennedy, tony coelho, and then the bill was finally passed and signed by george h.w. bush. it was a great success in showing that bipartisanship – bringing people together to solve a problem that affected millions of our fellow citizens – could actually work.

we've come a long way in the last 25 years. we still have work to do. we're by no means finished. and when i was secretary of state, president obama and i wanted to get passed the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. we held an event at the white house. we lined up sponsors, both in the congress and outside, because it required the congress – the senate – to pass. and then we worked really hard, and the republicans would not support it in the numbers needed. they wouldn't even listen to the pleas of their former leader, senator robert dole, who as you know lost the use of an arm when he was in the military in world war ii.

so there's a lot of unfinished business – both at home, and around the world. but i personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation – first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue – that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in america.

we have our faults and we have our challenges, but there isn't any nation that has continually tried to push forward to widen the circle of opportunity the way we have. despite the continuing problems that we face, we're going to keep doing that.

so i want to applaud you, jan, and others who have been at the forefront of this movement. i want to introduce the todds – dale, sara and adam – who are here. i've turned over my twitter account to sara to be tweeting about the challenges they face as a family with a young man who's got some challenges himself because i think we all have to recognize that as much progress as we've made, we still have work to do. so i want to thank you for being leaders and advocates on behalf of the community.
thank you so much, strobe. thank you so much.

well let me thank you, strobe. it's great to be back at brookings and there are a lot of long-time friends and colleagues who perch here at brookings. obviously, including strobe and martin, who i'll speak to in a minute. also bob einhorn and tammy wittes.

this institution has hosted many important conversation over the years and i appreciate strobe's reference to the event last night and the continuing dialogue about urgent issues facing our nation and the world. that's what brings me here today, back to brookings, to talk about the question we're all grappling with: how to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and more broadly, how to protect ourselves and our allies from the full range of threats that iran poses.

the stakes are high and there are no simple of perfectly satisfying solutions. so these questions, and in particular the merits of the nuclear deal recently reached with iran, have divided people of good will and raised hard issues on both sides.

here is how i see it. either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block iran's path to a nuclear weapon or, we turn down a more dangerous path, leading to a far-less certain and riskier future. that's why i support this deal. i support it as part of a larger strategy toward iran.

by now, the outcome in congress is no longer in much doubt. so we've got to start looking made to what comes next, enforcing the deal, deterring iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies. these will be my goals as president and today i want to talk about how i would achieve them.

let me start by saying i understand the skepticism so many feel about iran. i too am deeply concerned about iranian aggression and the need to confront it. it's a ruthless, brutal regime that has the blood of americans, many others and including its own people on its hands.

its political rallies resound with cries of, "death to america." its leaders talk about wiping israel off the face of the map, most recently just yesterday, and foment terror against it. there is absolutely no reason to trust iran.

now, vice president cheney may hope that the american people will simply forget, but the truth is, by the time president obama took office and i became secretary of state, iran was racing toward a nuclear capability.

they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, meaning that they had the material, scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons. they had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges, expanded their secret facilities, established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. and they haven't suffered many consequences.

i voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from new york. but they weren't having much effect. most of the world still did business with iran. we needed to step up our game.

so president obama and i pursued a two-prong strategy: pressure and engagement. we made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if iran answered the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way.

we simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of iranian defiance. we systematically increased our military capabilities in the region, deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more fire power, an additional aircraft carrier, battleship, strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available.

meanwhile, i traveled the world capital by capital, leader by leader, twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history.

with president obama's leadership, we worked with congress and the european union to cut iran off from the world's economic and financial system. and one by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of iranian oil, like india and south korea, to cut back.

soon, iran's tankers sat rusting in port. its economy was collapsing.

these new measures were effective because we made them global. american sanctions provided the foundation, but iran didn't really feel the heat until we turned this into an international campaign so biting that iran had no choice but to negotiate. they could no longer play off one country against another; they had no place to hide.

so they started looking for a way out. i first visited oman to speak with the sultan of oman in january of 2011, went back later that year. the sultan helped set up a secret back channel. i sent one of my closest aids as part of a small team to begin talks with the iranians in secret.

negotiations began in earnest after the iranian election in 2013. first, the bilateral talks led by deputy secretary bill burns and jake sullivan that led to the interim agreement, then the multilateral talks led by secretary john kerry, secretary ernie moniz and undersecretary wendy sherman.

now there's a comprehensive agreement on iran's nuclear program. is it perfect? well, of course not. no agreement like this ever is.

but is a strong agreement? yes, it is. and we absolutely should not turn it down.

the merits of the deal have been well-argued, so i won't go through them in great detail here. the bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. it blocks every pathway for iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance.  without a deal, iran's breakout time, how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, would shrink to a couple of months. with a deal, that breakout time stretches to a year, which means that if iran cheats, we'll know it, and we'll have time to respond decisively.

without a deal, we would have no credible inspections of iran's nuclear facilities. with a deal, we'll have unprecedented access; we'll be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program.

now, some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after 15 years. and we need to be vigilant about that, which i'll talk more about in a moment. but other parts are permanent, including iran's obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol.

others have expressed concern that it could take up to 24 days to gain access to some of iran's facilities when we suspect cheating. i'd be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect. although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle.

it's important to focus on that, because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond. but our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places, this deal does the job. microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years. they are impossible to hide. that's why secretary moniz, a nuclear physicist, has confidence in this plan.

and some are suggested we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better, unspecified deal. i can certainly understand why that may sound appealing, but as someone who started these talks in the first place, and built our global coalition piece by piece, i can assure you it is not realistic. plus, if we walk away now, our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished.

we will be blamed, not the iranians.

so if we were to reject this agreement, iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing. no restrictions on their nuclear program. no real warning if tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb. and the international sanctions regime would fall apart, so no more economic consequences for iran, either. those of use who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection; it's the balancing of risk.

and on balance, the far riskier course right now would be to walk away. great powers can't just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us. we need to be reasonable and consistent, and keep our word, especially when we are trying to lead a coalition.

that is how we will make this and future deals work. but it is not enough to say, "yes," to the deal. of course it isn't.we have to say, yes, and—yes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront iran's bad behavior in the region. yes, and we will begin from day one to set the conditions, so iran knows it will never get a nuclear weapon, not during the term of the agreement, not after, not ever. we need to be clear. and i think we have to make that very clear to iran about what we expect from them. this is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldn't accept that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior.

that shouldn't be a promise for proceeding, instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios. first, iran tries to cheat, something it's been quite willing to do in the past. second, iran tries to wait us out, perhaps it waits to move for 15 years when some, but not all restrictions expire. and third, iran ramps up the dangerous behavior in the region, including its support for terrorist groups like hamas and hezbollah.

i believe the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges. so let me tell you what i would do. my starting point will be one of distrust.

you remember president reagan's line about the soviets: trust but verify? my approach will be distrust and verify. we should anticipate that iran will test the next president, they'll want to see how far they can bend the rules. that won't work if i'm in the white house.

i will hold the line against iranian noncompliance, that means penalties even for small violations, keeping our allies on board, but being willing to snapback sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to, working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions. right now members of congress are offering proposals to that affect and i think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken.

finally it means insuring that the iaea has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold iran's feet to the fire. the most important thing we can do to keep iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shaped iranian expectations right from the start. the iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to.

so here is my message to iran's leaders, the united states will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon. as president, i will take whatever action is necessary to protect the united states and our allies, i will not hesitate to take military action if iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and i will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same pledge. we will make clear to iran that our commitment to prevention will not waver depending on who is in office, it's permanent.

should it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force, we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act. and because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first, the world will more likely join us.

then there is the broader issue of countering iran's bad behavior across the region. taking nuclear-weapons out of the equation is crucial because an iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous, than an iran without them.

but even without nuclear weapons, we still see iran's fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the middle east. they support bad actors from syria, to lebanon, to yemen. they vow to destroy israel. and that's worth saying again. they vow to destroy israel. we can not ever take that lightly, particularly when iran ships and advanced missiles to hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating israel, or talks about how israel won't exist in 25 years just like he did today.

and in addition to the malicious activity they already underwrite, we have got to anticipate that iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more. so as president i will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board. my strategy will be based on five strong pillars.

first, i will deepen america's unshakeable commitment to israel's security, including our long standing tradition of guaranteeing israel's qualitative military edge. i'll increase support for israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. i'll sell israel the most sophisticated fire aircraft ever developed. the f-35. we'll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for northern israel, which has been subjected to hezbollah's attacks for years.

second, i will reaffirm that the persian gulf is a region of vital interest to the united states. we do not want any of iran's neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon's program either. so we want them to feel and be secure. i will sustain a robust military presence in the region, especially our air and naval forces. we'll keep the strait of hormuz open. we'll increase security cooperation with our gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against iranian aggression. even if that takes the form of cyberattacks or other non-traditional threats.

iran should understand that the united states and i as president, will not stand by as our gulf allies and partners are threatened. we will act. third, i will be a coalition to counter iran's proxies, particularly hezbollah. that means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to hezbollah. looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is.

it's time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings. if you're part of hezbollah, you're part of a terrorist organization, plain and simple. beyond hezbollah, i'll crack down on the shipment of weapons to hamas. and push turkey and qatar to end their financial support. i'll press our partners in the region to prevent aircrafts and ships owned by companies linked to iran's revolutionary guard from entering their territories, and urge our partners to block iranian plans from entering their airspace on their way to yemen and syria.

across the board, i will vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, other american sanctions on iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities.  i'll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to iran and from iran to bad actors like syria, and i'll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they're in iran or overseas. this will be a special imperative, as some of the u.n. sanctions lapse, so the u.s. and our partners have to step up.

fourth, i'll stand, as i always have, against iran's abuses at home, from its detention of political prisoners, to its crack down on freedom of expression, including online. its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people. our quarrel is not and never has been that the iranian people. they'd have a bright future, hopeful future if they weren't held back by their leaders.

as i've said before, i think we were too restrained in our support of the protests in june 2009 and in our condemnation of the government crack down that followed. that won't happen again. we will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanction and i will not rest until every single american detained or missing in iran is home.

fifth, just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader iran policy. our broader iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.

iran, like isis, benefits from chaos and strife. it exploits other countries' weaknesses and the best defense against iran are the countries and governments being strong, that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism.

helping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline, but it's crucial that the united states leads this effort. i will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that iran fuels. we have to bring sufficient pressure on assad to force a political solution in syria, including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate syrian opposition, something i called for early in the conflict, and the united states must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict, especially the millions of syrian refugees now beseeching the world to help them.

as pope francis reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response, and the united states must help lead that response. that's who we are, and that's what we do.

so our strategy needs to cover all these bases, iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, its hatred of israel and its cruelty towards its citizens, its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses. we need to be creative, committed and vigilant, and on every front, we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners.

on that note, let me just spend a minute speaking about the serious concerns that israel's leaders have about this deal. israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction.  i would not support this agreement for one second if i thought it put israel in greater danger. i believe in my core that israel and america must stand side by side, and i—i will always stand by israel's right to defend itself, as i always have.  i believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes israel safer.

i say that with humility. i'm not israeli. i don't know what it's like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin. i know that my saying this deal makes you safer won't alleviate the very real fears of the israeli people.

but i have stood for israeli security for a very long time. it was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state. it's why i supported stronger defense systems, like the iron dome anti-rocket defense system, which proved so effective in protecting israeli lives during the conflicts of 2012 and last summer, that's why i've worked closely with israel to advance the two-state vision of a jewish and democratic israel with secure and recognized borders, and it's why i believe we should expedite negotiations of a long-term military assistance agreement with israel.

let's not wait until 2017 when the current deal expires; let's get it done this year.

i would invite the israeli prime minister to the white house during my first month in office to talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of close, frequent consultation right from the start, because we both rely on each other for support as partners, allies and friends.

this isn't just about policy for me; it is personal. as president, i'm committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries.

we have had honest disagreements about this deal. now is the time to come together. now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it.

and so i know well that the same forces that threaten israel threaten the united states. and to the people of israel, let me say, you'll never have to question whether we're with you. the united states will always be with you. there have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home. smart, serious people can see issues like these differently, like my friend, chuck schumer, who's going to be an excellent leader in the senate. i respect the skepticism that he and others feel, and i respect differences of opinion and people who advocate vigorously for their beliefs.

but i have a harder time respecting those who approach an issue as serious as this with unserious talk, especially anyone running to be president of the united states.

several republican candidates boast they'll tear up this agreement in 2017, more than a year after it's been implemented. that's not leadership; that's recklessness. it would set us right down the very dangerous path we have worked so hard to avoid.

i'm looking forward to a—a robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign. where we have disagreements, we should lay them out, like if american ground forces in iraq should engage in direct combat, as scott walker wants, or if we should keep cuba closed, as marco rubio and jeb bush want. let's debate these issues.  but let's debate them on the basis of facts, not fear. let's resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us, and let's avoid at all costs undermining america's credibility abroad. that only makes us weaker, and i am going to call it out whenever i see it.

i spent four years representing america abroad as america—secretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life, and knowing my fellow americans were counting on the and rooting for me, not as democrats, not as republicans, but as americans, meant to great deal.

we are all one team, the american team and that doesn't change, no matter how much we may disagree. i can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas, when we are united at home. so we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing. there is a lot democrats and republicans can and should agree on.

the united states should lead in the middle east, we can agree on that. we should stand by our friends against iranian aggression, we can agree on that, too. i believe the plan i have laid out today is one that all americans could endorse, and i hope they will.

the next president will face threats from many quarters, from those we see today like terrorism from isis, aggressiveness from putin, pandemics like ebola, to all those we can't predict yet.

we need a leader who has a strong vision for the future, and the skill and determination to get us there. we can't stop the world from changing, but we can help to shape those changes, and we can do that by beating with strength, smarts and unyielding commitment to our values. you know, i saw that when i was first lady, senator, secretary of state, that when america leads with principal and purpose, other people and governments are eager to join us.

no country comes close to matching our advantages, the strength of our economy, the skill of our work force, tradition of innovation, our unmatched network of alliances and partnership. so, we are poised to remain that world's most admired and powerful nation for of long time, if we make this smart choices and practice smart leadership. that is what i will try to do as your president, and i believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us, and that america's greatest contributions to the world are yet to come.

thank you all very much well, i don't see iran as our partner in implementing the agreement. i believe that iran is the subject of the agreement, that it now faces obligations that frankly, in many instances, it faced before the agreement and that they have a—signed an agreement where they are committing themselves to fulfill the terms of the agreement.

the agreement will be enforced not by iran, the agreement will be enforced by the rest of the negotiators, the other countries plus the iaea, and it will be and is intended to be quite burdensome and intrusive into iran.

now, maybe they believe that having signed the agreement, they can somehow avoid the consequences of the inspections and the other requirements, but i think they understand very well they're at the starting line, there are these demands that they are supposed to fulfill, there is a sequencing of you know, lifting of sanctions and other kinds of benefits that they receive in return for they're having taken the action required.

and i think they are, if anything, probably counting on the world led by the united states being distracted, being diverted, getting tired, not having the staying power to consistently enforce the agreement and hold iran accountable, and i for one, want to make clear to them that that is not going to happen, that we will take seriously every aspect of this agreement and we will expect them to comply and there will be consequences if they do not. well, you know, martin, it's not only iran that is invested, we're—obviously it's now becoming public, we are learning much more about russian investment, russian troops on the ground. it may very well be opening the door to greater russian involvement. there is no doubt that russian has—russia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode.

so we are facing the collapse of syria, the survival thus far of the assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from iran and russia to propping up assad.

so i—you know, i was the principal negotiator on the geneva 2012 agreement, which russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution. it wasn't very long until russia reneged on what they had signed. but i think it still provides a very credible framework threat from the terrorist groups and that the chaos in syria can destabilize the region in ways that are bad for iran. and therefore the higher the pressure is for some kind of reaction to what is going on inside syria, and certainly the efforts that isis is making to take even more and hold territory in iraq directly against what iran sees as its interest, the continuing destabilization along the lebanese border, there's all kinds of reasons why iran is going to have to confront this instability.

so i think we—my view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for iran and for russia all the time. now, if putin were sitting here—which is hard to imagine, but if he were—i should ask strobe—strobe is the expert. he would say, "we're fighting terrorism, that's what we are doing. there may be a way to begin to join those efforts." well, you know very well it is a difficult one. i apologize for my voice i'm suffering under massive allergy assault. yes, republican histamines are everywhere.

so—you know, martin, this is one of the biggest problems we face, nobody can deny that much of the extremism in the world today is the direct result of policies and funding undertaken by the saudi government and individuals. we would be foolish not to recognize that, i think increasingly they would be mistaken not to recognize that.

you can never be more extreme than the next extremist and i think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes. i am not sure they are convinced of that. i am not sure they believe that they have to figure out different ways of dealing with their own population and cooperating with each other, and cutting off funding, and exporting troublesome imams to elsewhere. but i think you have to be constantly beating that drum with them, and maybe now, given the rise of isis and the very clear threat they feel from, you know, iranian activities in the gulf that maybe there's an openness there. i know that the king was here last week, had a chance to, you know, meet with the president.

so perhaps there's more of an opportunity for a candid dialogue than we've had in the past. however, having said that, i still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising. yes, i would, robin. and i—and i would because i think that we have to attempt to do that, you know?  when i first went to oman in january of 2011, we didn't know whether any effort at some kind of secret channel would pay off. we still had the p5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the united states did would have to merge into the international approach.

but we had to begin to explore it. and we did. and we explored it over that summer. that's when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible. it takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who's at the table, what the conversation's about, how seriously it will be taken, who's backing you up. and so, then when the—the talks actually started, just in the iranian-american channel with bill burns and jake sullivan and bob einhorn was also involved.

it was—it was exploratory and it laid down some of the—the ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger p5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in iran and there was some real seriousness of effort.

so with respect to the other issues, i—i—i have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion. they don't want to talk about yemen, they don't want to talk about anything other than the nuclear agreement. now that was a strategic decision we made back then.

you know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed. they wanted to talk about everything as a way to get some items on the table to trade off for the nuclear agreement, so that they would not have to make, perhaps, as many concessions as we were expecting them to make. that's why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program.

we also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the iranians, and you can understand why. i mean, they—you know, if they weren't going to be at the table, they didn't want the united states talking about yemen or talking about anything else of interest, of vital interest in their views to them.

so if there were a way to construct such a—a channel, i would be open to it, but i'm just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of the—the region's vital interests. and—and i think when it comes to syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to iran about syria because we knew iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought iran in.

so we have to—you know, we have to readjust this all the time. just as i said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it's also the—the constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn't happen before. so i'm open but i am very sober about how it would have to be constructed and what it would actually cover and who would have to be either at the table or you know, in the—in the first chair behind, so that they didn't feel that they were being left out or negotiated over. so i think that's a very—it's an important questions. i don't know if you could hear the question. but it was—it was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution? and how would we do more to—as i understood what you said, you know, work with our european partners on these securities issues that are challenging europe? and we see that everyday with the refugees because it's humanitarian but it's also a security challenge as well?

well, you know, i—i have been—i remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on russia, and in particular on putin. i think we have not done enough. i am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of crimea and the continuing destabilization of ukraine. i understand the hesitation, not only in our country but most importantly, in europe.

the sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact. i think the falling oil price has had more impact and we've got to figure out how we you know, combine both in looking at ways to put more—to up the costs, to put more pressure on putin. i think it's one of the long term security challenges that united states, europe, and especially nato face. and i don't think we can dance around it very much longer.

i mean, we all wish it wasn't the case. we all wish it would go away. we all wish that putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting russian power in places like syria and elsewhere.

but i think the jury is in, i think that he intends to continue to do what he is doing and go as far as he can get away with. and i believe that we've got to regroup—we've got to regroup quickly, because i worry very much about what's happening in syria right now.

troops on the ground to allegedly protect military supplies. what is russia's real objective? you know, the stated objective, the public objective, to fight terrorism, has always been their rationale. why did they support assad? because after assad there would be terrorism. now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might've avoided this. we might've actually help to midwife a political transition. so i think we've got to spend a lot more time.

all the—you know, all the russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the berlin wall, i hope that they will be dusting off their materials and i'm looking right at strobe talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us. because, i think russia's objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine american power whenever and wherever they can. i don't think there's much—you know, i don't think there's much to be surprised about that.so where we can work with them? you know, that's one of the—you know, one of the criticisms that sometimes comes from the right, the republicans. you know, "what did the reset ever accomplish?" well, medvedev was president actually quite a lot. we did the new start agreement. we got cooperation on iran because when we got the security council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under medvedev in june of 2010. we got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to russia to resupply our troops. we got a lot.

now, that all changed once you know, putin announced he was going to be president again now. there's—i don't admire very much about mr. putin, but the idea you can stand and say, "i will be your next president." that does have a certain, you know, attraction to it.

so, you know, i think we've got—we've really—we are not spending the—the time. we're not thinking, we're not digging deep into what are we going to do. so, to answer the question of the—of the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter russian aggression in europe and beyond. and try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don't lose sight of the architect because we're going to have a lot of issues up there well.

so, i—i—i was always of that opinion. expressed it vocally within the administration. and nothing that has happened since has in anyway persuaded me other wise. well, i—i do think we're capable of doing more than one thing although sometimes it appears difficult. and—and i think we've got to be much more global in our thinking and globally present. the rebalancing to asia, otherwise known as the pivot, was in response to the very real sense of abandonment that asian leaders expressed to me. my phone calls to them before i ever went to the region in february of 2009, you know, they—they believed that because we were focused in afghanistan and we were so focused in iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in asia. i think we've come along in some ways in trying to rebalance but we have a long to go.

and there's much at stake in how we deal with all the players in asia. i'm hoping that the upcoming trip i have with president xi jinping produces some positive outcomes. i thought the climate agreement was quite consequential having been in copenhagen in '09 with the president when we literally had to break into a meeting where the chinese were consolidating india, south africa and brazil against any kind of movement toward the non advanced economies taking responsibility. so i think we've got some good stakes in the ground but we don't have a—a strategy yet that is going to be consistent.

and the final thing i'll say about this, martin, and i alluded to it in my remarks, i think one of our—one of our real problems right now is we don't have a consistent foreign policy that is bipartisan, let alone non-partisan. and i think that's a problem.

i mean, i was appalled when those republican senators wrote to the ayatollah. i thought it was incredibly, you know, short-sighted and you know, wrong-headed. and i don't think—i don't know what we rebuild a consistent foreign policy from administration to administration, regardless of republican or democrat. you know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the soviet union, i understand that, but i think we really have to work at it. and we can't work at it if we don't have a set of strategic pillars and organizing principles that we can present to our own people and present to the congress and present to the world.

so i think we have work to do. as to the first one, you know, it's always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done. if we remember back to that time, prime minister cameron had lost the vote in the parliament. he wanted to show support for the president's policy of taking some limited military action in light of syria's use of chemical weapons.

so it became clear that there was going to be a difficult vote in the congress, not clear at all that it would successful, which would have left the president with authority, certainly, with executive authority to act. but since it had become a public debate, it would have been a much more difficult decision for him to make.

i do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us. i am certain of that. that still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home and—and people from other countries, but i do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without russian cooperation. i think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the russians about what needed to be done in syria and what needed to be done with assad. they did not reciprocate on that. so you know, i think it's like much in—in international relations, it's a—it's a mixed picture, some positive, you know, some—some negative.

with respect to the refugees, i have said i think that you know, we're coming up on the u.n. general assembly. i think there should be an emergency global gathering where the u.n. literally tries to get commitments. you know, we did that with haiti. after the haiti earthquake, we had a huge gathering at the u.n. where literally it was like a pledging conference, where we said, "what are you going to do?" what—you know, "what can you contribute?"

and little countries to big countries all stepped up and it was a great show of support in the face of a terrible natural disaster. we need to do something similar, and i've—i've publicly called on the u.n. to convene such a gathering. i do it again today in front of all of you.

the united states has to be at the table, has to be leading it. we were in a strong position to do that on haiti. i think, even though it's not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our european friends, i think this is a global responsibility. and if you're too far away or for whatever reason you don't think you can take refugees then you have to contribute money.

you should be supporting not only those refugees fleeing, but the incredible work that jordan and lebanon and turkey have been doing, and they have not gotten the financial support they need. in fact, the last i checked, the u.n. appeal had only reached 37 percent, so there is both financial work and contributions that need to be forthcoming and countries need to be more open and willing to take refugees.

i obviously want the united states to do our part but i also want this to be a global response. so i hope that with all these leaders gathered, with pope francis addressing the united nations general assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the eu or other organizations as well. well i'll restrain myself and answer the first questions first. i think there is an opportunity here to succeed, i really do. i don't think it's easy. but let's just go back a few years.

not so long ago, israel and turkey were working very closely together on a number of issues. then came the flotilla and then came the response by the israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was a—not just a - a working relationship but a real bridge.

similarly, there have been a number of instances where in the past, israel has worked in common concert with a number of the gulf countries. israel is now back in a very productive relationship with egypt, obviously with jordan. so there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that i think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together.

 i don't—i don't know that it's something the united states can lead, but it's certainly something that we can try to catalyze and encourage. and i think there is potential there because as i said in my speech, i will do everything i can to convince turkey and (qatar) that supporting hamas is not in their interest. it's not in the region's interest. it's certainly not in egypt's interest. they both care deeply about, you know, what happens in egypt for somewhat different reasons than others, but they care.

and so i think we have to build the case and i think american diplomats could help build that case. and then look for ways—i mean, i spent, you know, literally years trying to get the israelis to finally apologize to the turks on the flotilla. and there was a memorable day during one of my vacations where i was literally, you know, talking to the israelis. i was talking to henry kissinger. i was talking to everybody i could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps.

finally that happened when president obama went to israel. and i was very happy that, you know, now we have a different turkey with a different kind of, set of challenges, but interests remain the same. turkey's interest for stability are not so different than they were, even though some of the leadership attitudes seem to have altered. so i would like to see us do everything we can. i would make a high priority of that.

i hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let's start seeing what we can do. it kind of goes back to robin's question. you know, you don't know what you can achieve until you try to put the pieces together. and i think the more we can try to put those pieces together, the more we'll know whether or not something can come up.

with respect to the lack of support for the agreement, honestly, i think it's—it's—it's in some instances genuine. just as i said in my remarks, there are people who i deeply respect on the democratic side certainly and i would respect them on the republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don't feel have been answered. but i think the driving force behind it is, you know, to close ranks against the president, against this kind of diplomacy, but without offering an alternative.

and that's what i find, i mean i don't mind debating alternatives. i mean, when we did the new start treaty, it was really hard to get the votes for that. i remember, you know, going up and making the case, but we got some republican votes. but we're living in a very partisan atmosphere right now. and i do think we have to do more. just as we, and i'll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won't join, because they have been consulted. they have been brought along, they have been briefed. we have to do that with the congress as well. and it's not—it's not easy if they don't even have open minds.

but we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, "we told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven't come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us.  you're just opposing us. so it's—it's—it's very political, after discounting those who i think are—are genuinely skeptical. thank you mr. chairman, ranking member cummings, members of the committee. the terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the cia post in benghazi, libya on september 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave americans: ambassador chris stevens, sean smith, glen doherty, and tyrone woods.

i am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the diplomatic security agency and the cia officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.

i knew and admired chris stevens. he was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the middle east that he came to know so well.

when the revolution broke out in libya, we named chris as our envoy to the opposition. there was no easy way to get him into benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century american envoy. but his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.

it is a testament to the relationships that he built in libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of libyans poured into the streets in benghazi. they held signs reading "thugs don't represent benghazi or islam." "sorry people of america, this is not the behavior of our islam or our prophet." "chris stevens, a friend to all libyans."

although i didn't have the privilege of meeting sean smith personally, he was a valued member of our state department family. an air force veteran, he was an information management officer, who had served in pretoria, baghdad, montreal, and the hague.

tyrone woods and glen doherty worked for the cia. they were killed by mortar fire at the cia's outpost in benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. they were both former navy seals and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in iraq and afghanistan.

as secretary of state, i had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.

losing any one of them, as we did in iraq, afghanistan, mexico, haiti, and libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire state department and usaid family, and for me personally.

i was the one who asked chris to go to libya as our envoy. i was the one who recommended him to be our ambassador to to the president.

after the attacks, i stood next to president obama as marines carried his casket and those of the other three americans off the plane at andrews air force base.

i took responsibility. and, as part of that, before i left office, i launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.

what happened in benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting accountability review board, seven prior congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

so today i would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.

first, america must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.

the state department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.

chris stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. in fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.

he also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.

and make no mistake: the risks are real. terrorists have killed more than sixty-five american diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.

since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on u.s. diplomatic facilities around the world.

but if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.

it would compound the tragedy of benghazi if chris stevens' death and the death of the other three americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.

we have learned the hard way when america is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.

that's why chris was in benghazi. it's why he had served previously in syria, egypt, saudi arabia, and jerusalem during the second intifada.

nobody knew the dangers of libya better – a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. but chris chose to go to benghazi because he understood america had to be represented there at that pivotal time.

he knew that eastern libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. and if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including egypt and tunisia.

he also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. the nearest israeli airport is just a day's drive from the libyan border.

above all, chris understood that most people, in libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. that's what those thousands of libyans were saying after they learned of his death. he understood there was no substitute for going beyond the embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.

retreat from the world is not an option. america cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. that doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. quite the opposite.

we need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of america's strengths and values. leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.

and at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like chris stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed – as i do – that america is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.

my second observation is this: we have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.

after previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. that's what happened during the reagan administration, when hezbollah attacked our embassy. they killed 63 people, including 17 americans. and then in a later attack, attacked our marine barracks and killed so many more. those two attacks in beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 americans.

it's what happened during the clinton administration when al qaeda bombed our embassies in kenya and tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve americans. it's what happened during the bush administration after 9/11.

part of america's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.

after the benghazi attacks, i asked ambassador thomas pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with admiral mike mullen, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appointed by president george w. bush, to lead an accountability review board. this is an institution that the congress set up after the terrible attacks in beirut. there have been eighteen previous accountability review boards. only two have ever made any of their findings public. the one following the attacks on our embassies in east africa and the one following the attack on benghazi. the accountability review board did not pull a single punch. they found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two state department bureaus.

and the review board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. i pledged that by the time i left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. and they were. more marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. additional diplomatic security agents were being hired and trained.

and secretary kerry has continued this work. but there is more to do. and no administration can do it alone. congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.

for example, the accountability review board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. but efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by congress. the men and women who serve our country deserve better.

finally, there is one more observation i'd like to share:

i traveled to 112 countries as secretary of state. every time i did, i felt great pride and honor representing the country that i love. we need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.

our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.

as secretary of state, i worked with the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with russia. i worked with republican leader, senator mitch mcconnell, to open up burma, now myanmar, to find democratic change.

i know it's possible to find common ground, because i have done it.

we should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. we should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.

so i am here. despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, i am here to honor those we lost and to do what i can to aid those who serve us still.

and my challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge i put to myself.

let's be worthy of the trust the american people have bestowed upon us. they expect us to lead. to learn the right lessons. to rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.

that's what i tried to do every day as secretary of state. and it's what i hope we all strive for here today and into the future. thank you. thank you, richard. and thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. it truly is an important resource for us all.

fareed, i look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the council, and mr. mayor. thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. i'm very grateful.

i wanted to come here to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week, and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends.

when the united states was hit on 9/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. now, it's our turn to stand in solidarity with france and all of our friends. we cherish the same values. we face the same adversaries. we must share the same determination.

after a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. the world's great democracies can't sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. therefore, we must choose resolve. and we must lead the world to meet this threat.

now, let's be clear about what we're facing. beyond paris in recent days, we've seen deadly terrorist attacks in nigeria, lebanon, iraq and turkey, and a russian civilian airline destroyed over the sinai. at the heart of today's new landscape of terror is isis. they persecute religious and ethnic minorities; kidnap and behead civilians; murder children. they systematically enslave, torture and rape women and girls.

isis operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in iraq and syria; an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond; and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. we have to target and defeat all three, and time is of the essence.

isis is demonstrating new ambition, reach and capabilities. we have to break the group's momentum and then its back. our goal is not to deter or contain isis, but to defeat and destroy isis.

but we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks, only to face metastasizing threats down the road, so we also have to play and win the long game. we should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, one that embeds our mission against isis within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it's al qaida or isis or some other network.

an immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily torn out. it will require sustained commitment in every pillar of american power. this is a worldwide fight, and american must lead it.

our strategy should have three main elements. one, defeat isis in syria, iraq and across the middle east; two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing arms and propaganda around the world; three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.

let me start with the campaign to defeat isis across the region. the united states and our international coalition has been conducting this fight for more than a year. it's time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny isis control of territory in iraq and syria. that starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes and a broader target set.

a key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about isis and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, arabic speakers with deep expertise in the middle east and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al qaida in the past. this would help us identify and eliminate isis' command and control and its economic lifelines.

a more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient, and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from isis. like president obama, i do not believe that we should again have 100,000 american troops in combat in the middle east. that is just not the smart move to make here. if we have learned anything from 15 years of war in iraq and afghanistan, it's that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. we can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. but we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission.

now, the obstacles to achieving this are significant. on the iraqi side of the border, kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to re-take towns from isis, but the iraqi national army has struggled, and it's going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. as part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes.

ultimately, however, a ground campaign in iraq will only succeed if more iraqi sunnis join the fight. but that won't happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront isis.

now, we've been in a similar place before in iraq. in the first sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out al qaida. unfortunately, under prime minister maliki's rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten.

so the task of bringing sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. but nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second sunni awakening. we need to put sustained pressure on the government in baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard. baghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming sunni and kurdish forces in the war against isis. but if baghdad won't do that, the coalition should do so directly.

on the syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage isis, beyond the syrian kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting assad who, let us remember, has killed many more syrians than the terrorists have. but they are increasingly under threat from isis as well.

so we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more syrians to take on isis as well. to support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force president obama has already authorized, and be prepared to deploy more as more syrians get into the fight. and we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable syrian opposition units.

our increased support should go hand in hand with increased support from our arab and european partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. we should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward europe.

this combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the turkish border from isis, choking off its supply lines. it would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that secretary kerry is pursuing.

of course, we've been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. but we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. we can learn lessons from lebanon and bosnia about what it will take. and russia and iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability.

right now, i'm afraid, president putin is actually making things somewhat worse.

now, to be clear, though, there is an important role for russia to help in resolving the conflict in syria. and we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves syria as a unitary, nonsectarian state, with protections for the rights of all syrians and to keep key state institutions intact.

there is no alternative to a political transition that allows syrians to end assad's rule.

now, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our arab and turkish partners. and we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in iraq and syria.

countries like jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the arabs and turks step up in a much bigger way. this is their fight and they need to act like it.

so far, however, turkey has been more focused on the kurds than on countering isis. and to be fair, turkey has a long and painful history with kurdish terrorist groups. but the threat from isis cannot wait. as difficult as it may be, we need to get turkey to stop bombing kurdish fighters in syria who are battling isis, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against isis.

the united states should also work with our arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against isis. at the moment, they're focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from iran. that's why the saudis, for example, shifted attention from syria to yemen. so we have to work out a common approach.

in september, i laid out a comprehensive plan to counter iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as hezbollah and hamas. we cannot view iran and isis as separate challenges. regional politics are too interwoven. raising the confidence of our arab partners and raising the costs to iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against isis.

and as we work out a broader regional approach, we should, of course, be closely consulting with israel, our strongest ally in the middle east. israel increasingly shares with our arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and joint efforts as well.

now, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. we have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring along a lot of partners, move on multiple fronts at once. but if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, i do believe we can crush isis's enclave of terror.

and to support this campaign, congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. that will send a message to friend and foe alike that the united states is committed to this fight. the time for delay is over. we should get this done.

now, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of iraq and syria, to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online.

a terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms and propaganda around the world has allowed isis to strike at the heart of paris last week and an al qaida affiliate to do the same at charlie hebdo earlier this year. isis is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with isis and its ambitious plans, but even al qaida, including the death of osama bin laden, they are still posing great threats to so many.

let's take one example. we've had a lot of conversation about isis in the last week, let's not forget al qaida. they still have the most sophisticated bombmakers, ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like yemen and north africa, so we can't just focus on iraq and syria, we need to intensify our counter—our counterterrorism efforts on a wider scope.

most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the middle east. thousands—thousands of young recruits have flocked to syria from france, germany, belgium, the united kingdom and, yes, even the united states. their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle hardened. stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information-sharing among countries every step of the way. we should not stop pressing until turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into syria, finally locks down its border.

the united states and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to syria. we also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. for example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents and more.

when it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. the u.n. security council should update its terrorism sanctions. they have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the united states, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. and once and for all, the saudis, the qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization. when it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in brussels where the paris attacks were planned. through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots.

radicalization and recruitment also is happening online. there's no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. we must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory.

at the state department, i built up a unit of communication specialists fluent in urdu, arabic, somali and other languages to battle with extremists online.

we need more of that, including from the private sector. social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts, so they're not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence.

online or off-line, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate, and we have to win. let's be clear, though, islam is not our adversary. muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. the obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilization, or repeating the specific words radical islamic terrorism isn't just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers more standing than they deserve. it actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side.

our priority should be how to fight the enemy. in the end, it didn't matter what kind of terrorist we call bin laden, it mattered that we killed bin laden. but we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the muslim world that continues to spread. its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from north and west africa to asia.

overlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit.

before the arab spring, i warned that the region's foundations would sink into the sand without immediate reforms. well, the need has only grown more urgent. we have to join with our partners to do the patient's steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists; supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law; creating economic growth that supports stability; working to curb corruption, helping training effective and accountable law enforcement, intelligence and counterterrorism services. as we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat.

when i became secretary of state, i was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats.

so, we created the global counterterrorism forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the muslim world. it should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats.

and let's not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons, and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.

at the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by u.s. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards when there are any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats.

all of this—stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace—is vital to the war against isis, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that.

now, the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and home-grown threats. after 9/11, the united states made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe.

we still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, europe is way behind. today, european nations don't even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. it seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected.

i appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. the united states must work with europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination. european countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant.

and here at home, we face a number of our own challenges. the threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs. so our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead. we know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. so they need all the resources and support we can give them.

law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country muslim americans. now, this should go without saying, but in the current climate, it bears repeating. muslim americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.

another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. we should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. they have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. on the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. so we need silicon valley not to view government as its adversary. we need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy.

now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack.

since paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle syrian refugees seeking safety in the united states. our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the american people. so yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals, in close coordination with our allies and partners.

and congress need to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. and we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations. turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against muslims, slamming the door on every syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. we are better than that.

and remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. we should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. we should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing syria.

and we can get this right. america's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism, but i actually believe it's one of our strengths. it reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities. this is not a time for scoring political points.

when new york was attacked on 9/11, we had a republican president, a republican governor and a republican mayor, and i worked with all of them. we pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. this is a time for american leadership. no other country can rally the world to defeat isis and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. only the united states can mobilize common action on a global scale, and that's exactly what we need. the entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it.

there's been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. everyone seems to want one, but there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis. i know how hard this is because we've done it before. to impose the toughest sanctions in history on iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in libya, to support a fledgling democracy in afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of american power—military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values. that is smart power.

we have to work with institutions and partners like nato, the e.u., the arab league and the u.n., strengthen our alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy, and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did it to bring osama bin laden to justice.

the united states and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity. this past week, as i watched the tragic scenes from france, i kept thinking back to a young man in the world met in january after the last attack in paris. his name was lassana, a muslim immigrant from mali who worked at a kosher market. he said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family.

when the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, lassana risked his life to protect his jewish customers. he moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room, and then slipping out to help the police.

"i didn't know or care, he said, if they were jews or christians or muslims. we're all in the same boat." what a rebuke to the extremists' hatred.

the french government announced it would grant lassana full citizenship. but when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already.

that's the power of free people. that's what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat. and as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together, and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere.

well, as i said in the speech, it is, in many ways, an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy. but it has to also intensify and accelerate our efforts in the other arenas.

what we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us.

what we have done, with the president saying there would be special forces sent, it is right in line with what i think that they need to get there, and we need to take stock of whether we need more, and we need to also empower our trainers in iraq to have more support to do what they're trying to accomplish by getting the iraqi army, once again, to be a fighting force.

and we need—one thing that i believe we haven't done yet is make it clear to baghdad that we are going to be arming sunni tribes and kurds if they don't, because at some point, they have to be in the fight. the kurds, as you know, are fighting bravely on both sides of the border, and they need the support that we've given them and some of the special ops work, and the assault and taking back of sinjar.

and then, these other two elements that i mentioned. we have pieces in place, but i think we have to deepen and better coordinate, not only within our own country in europe, but more broadly. look, i don't think it's useful to go back in and replow old ground. i think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution.

and there were so many groups fighting. there were so many other factors at work. now that isis has made clear that i think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the kurds, they're now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going.

so i think there's been, you know, an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it. well, it's not the first headline i've disagreed with.

look, i—i have made clear that i have differences, as i think any two people do. i was very proud to serve as president obama's secretary of state. i think we made a good team. we largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited, and to take on some of the new challenges we faced.

but even when i was still there, which is publicly known, i thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous syrian fighters, so-called "moderates"—and i do think there were some early on—that we could have done more to help them in their fight against assad. but, you know, this is an evolving and fast-moving situation. i think we're all, you know, working to, you know, make sure that what we do actually will produce the results we seek. when you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-secretary of defense bob gates. gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. this seems to me the major difference right now between what the president—what obama's administration is doing and what you're proposing.

do you not—why do you disagree with bob gates on this? well, i—i believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an american-only no-fly zone. i fully respect bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. but if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the syrian military, now supplemented by the russian air force.

and i think we have a chance to do that now. we have a no-fly zone over northern iraq for years to protect the kurds. and it proved to be successful, not easy—it never is—but i think now is the time for us to revisit those plans.

i also believe, as i said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, turkey discussed with me back when i was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they're going to do. and it can give us leverage in the discussions that secretary kerry is carrying on right now.

so i see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations. well, that's—we did build that coalition with respect to libya. we had the uae, qatar, jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests. and you're right, the saudis were actually involved in syria and now have put all of their resources against the houthis and the iranian backers of the houthis in yemen.

now, what does that mean? well, it means that they see the battle that they want to fight as one against iran and its proxies. my argument to them would be, left unattended, you could have iranian reach from tehran to baghdad. if you allow syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the iranians, the russians are interested in their naval base. and so you will find a consolidation of authority with the iranians and moving into baghdad even more so.

so what you're facing in yemen could be a limited preview of what you could face going forward, unless we get some concerted effort to stop the fighting and to seek a political solution that does give some room to all the different groups within syria to have a say in the future. well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named. as i mentioned in the speech, i spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the arab spring was breaking. and i did so not knowing about the arab spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand. it was going to explode at some point or another.

and with the developments in libya, for example, the libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. they have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. so it's—i think it's too soon to tell and i think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely.

now, deposing milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a deal—in fact, my husband's in dayton today speaking about the dayton accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together. is it perfect? no, but has it, you know, kind of going, and do we have some work to do there? absolutely.

so, we have to look at all these different situations, i think, on their own as well as part of bigger trends. well, i just don't think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country. we've had—last i looked, more than 2 million refugees since 1990.

so far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the united states, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included.

now, this is going to take a long time, i mean, really doing this is hard under any circumstances. doing it when people are essentially stateless, they don't necessarily have documents, it's hard to do the vetting, is going to be challenging. which is, again, why i said in the speech that congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it.

i just don't believe that's in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn't send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world.

so, yeah, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant and we have to have a system that does all of that.  i think—you know, there are two problems that i see with it.

one the final language of the treaty itself, which i don't think went far enough to meet the test that i've always applied to any trade agreement—i have voted for them and i have voted against them when i was a senator—does it help to create more good paying jobs in america? does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?

and i think there are enough unanswered questions. it was an—it was an extraordinary effort to try to bring these countries together to come up with an agreement, but i think that at the end of the day, for a number of reasons, including that they couldn't figure how to get currency into the agreement and it's only in a side agreement, i opposed it.

the other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so little—because of republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up in—against their head by globalization.

globalization is real, it's happening, it's having an impact. we don't have a good training program, we don't have the kind of support that people need to be able to move into positions where they can acquire new skills.

and i see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more americans to be competitive in the global economy, and i don't think we've done that. i want to see that done alongside any trade agreement to a greater extent than the republicans have been willing to support it. well amy, there's nothing magic or easy about putting together such a coalition. i know president hollande will be coming to the united states to see president obama this week, and i assume that there will be a group of french officials, defense officials, intelligence officials, homeland security officials who will be meeting with their american counterparts. and on the defense side, i think that certainly the united states working with france and then from that, you know, sort of hub beginning to reach out to other countries to seek out support. and i would go back to arab countries as well. so looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible.

you know, going back to libya, you know, the europeans were the ones who wanted american support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. and then we reached out and worked with the arab league so that there would be arab partners as well, and that took weeks. it wasn't something that just happened overnight. but it is definitely doable if we begin, i think, with the french-american position and move out from there. well, back in the first term when leon panetta and dave petraeus and i made our recommendation about vetting and arming syrian moderate rebels, the target was assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we've all seen. so that was what we recommended back in the first term.

since then, i know it's been a very difficult task for the—our government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with.

but what happened to some of the few groups that have been trained is that they were quickly overrun by much more hardened fighters who were fighting assad, so it was a—it was a very hard task to do, two or three years later. i think it might have been, but again, i have said many times, i can't predict sitting here what would have happened if we moved earlier.

it might have worked, it might not have worked. but you can't really take syrians who are rebelling against assad, and tell them they can't use their training and their weapons against the person who, as i said my speech, has killed far more syrians than isis has to date. well, certainly, described like that. and that's why i focused on isis. i mean, because i think it's—i think right now, we have one overriding goal. as i outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between syria and turkey.

there is not going to be a successful military effort at this point to overturn assad. that can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on isis, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter. there—we have to prioritize, and we had an opportunity, perhaps, i won't say that it would've worked. but right now, we've got the russians in protecting assad, the iranians and hezbollah protecting assad.

we need to get people to turn against the common enemy of isis, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within syria will be able to re-create a syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the alawites from damascus the same way it was before the civil war started.

well, it would certainly grow, but i think it would be a mistake.

look, as i said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones.

we have a lot of work to do to be able to really decimate isis in iraq and in syria. but we've got to work with the kurds on both sides of the border, we have got to figure out how to, if possible, have a second arab awakening in anbar province, get the sunni tribes to feel that it is their fight again, as they once did.

and that requires a lot of political pressure being put on baghdad. injecting some large contingent of american forces complicates that, in my opinion. right now, we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground, and get them to change their priorities and work together.  i am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern syria close to the turkish border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don't have to leave syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the syrians. and i would certainly expect to and hope to work with the russians to be able to do that.

you know, the russians have, as you know, then i primarily focused on assad's enemies and not on isis. i think that has changed, and there is an indication that has changed. after hollande comes here, he's going to go to moscow to see putin, and i—and as i said earlier, i think getting russia to play a role in that and getting assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which secretary kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for syrians so they wouldn't have to leave but also for humanitarian relief. and i think that it would give us this extra leverage that i'm looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with russia with respect to the political outcome in syria. well, i think that that the saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the saudis are now engaged in the discussions that secretary kerry is leading, they're in the same process as the iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved. and i think that the saudis have a multiple level of responsibilities, first and foremost, stopping their own citizens from continuing the financing for extremists.

and, you know, saudi financing is still a major source of revenue for terrorist groups inside syria, inside iraq elsewhere. i have no evidence of that, but there—isis has become quite a self-financing terrorist network with their theft of oil, selling it on the black market with their destruction and seizure of antiquities, selling that on the black market, with their taking over mosul and raiding the banks. they've got a source of funding, so i don't really know. but i know that the—that saudi individuals have certainly funded other related terrorist groups over time and also exported a lot of wahhabi radicalism by kicking out or sending out imams and teachers to set up schools and mosques to preach that particularly harsh brand of islam.

so the saudis have a lot that they can do to both stop and then to help. and that's why i said, look, they are legitimately concerned about a takeover in yemen that butts up against their border.

and so, that is why they are expending a lot of money and a lot of military resources, trying to beat back the houthis, trying to reestablish hadian government. they have got a lot going on there.

but i would hope to draw them into a broader reading of what's going on in the region. and you know, for a lot of people, the sunni-shia sectarian divide is one of the major reasons for what's happening there.

it's understandable, but the saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at iran's influence inside syria, their growing influence in iraq as well as in yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least northern syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the civil war.

and i hope they will be more willing to be involved.

thank you. thank you all very much. thank you. thank you.

i'm delighted to be here at this great university, one of the premier public institutions of higher education in our entire country. yes, indeed. just, you know, one of those statements of fact that deserves a response.

i want to thank my longtime friend, vice president mondale, for his kind words. his support in this campaign means a great deal to me personally, because i admire so much his service to our country. he is a great minnesotan and a great american, and we're so privileged to have him with us today.

i also want to acknowledge a few of the other elected officials who are here. i am, of course absolutely delighted to be joined by former colleagues and friends, your senators, amy klobuchar and al franken, who are quite the dynamic duo for your state. and i am grateful to them for everything they're doing and for their help and support of my campaign.

i also want to thank tina smith, your lieutenant governor, and steve simon, your secretary of state.

and i understand that betsy hodges is here, mayor of minneapolis.

and i also want to acknowledge the dean of the humphries school, eric schwartz. eric was my top advisor on refugee issues at the state department. i also had the great privilege of working with him when he was on the national security council during my husband's administration. you know, he brings a mix of expertise and empathy that has been conspicuously missing from much of our public debate.

and i am grateful he is here today, but i'm also a little jealous that all of you here at the university get to have the benefit of his experience.

you know, over the past several months, i have listened to the problems that keep american families up at night. now, most people don't expect life to be easy, but they do want more security, a good-paying job that lets you afford a middle class lifestyle, health care you can count on, a little bit put away for your retirement.

being secure also means being safe, safe at home, at school, at work. and today, i want to talk about how we keep our country safe from a threat that's on everyone's minds, the threat of terrorism.

but i want to begin by saying, we cannot give in to fear. we can't let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe, and doing it in way that is consistent with our values.

we cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe. americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity.

now, as we all know, on december 2nd, two shooters killed 14 people at a holiday party in san bernardino, california.

sadly, in america in 2015, turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual. but this one turned out to be different, because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by isis.

americans have experienced terrorism before. on 9/11, we learned that terrorists in afghanistan could strike our homeland. from fort hood to chattanooga to the boston marathon, we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks.

but san bernardino felt different. maybe it was the timing, coming so soon after paris. maybe it was how random it seemed, a terrorist attack in a suburban office park, not a high-profile target or symbol of american power. it made us all feel it could have been anywhere, at any time.

the phrase "active shooter" should not be one we have to teach our children. but it is.

and now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future, for our safety, our sense of well-being, and our trust and connections with our neighbors. we want to be open-hearted, and we want to celebrate america's diversity, not fear it.

and while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate isis and love peace, we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks.

just yesterday, a man in maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from isis for use in planning an attack. and here in minnesota, authorities have charged ten men with conspiring to provide material support to isis.

but in the twin cities, you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization: local imams condemning terrorist violence, local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda.

i just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with.

as the first somali-american police sergeant in minnesota, and probably in the country, said recently, "safety is a shared responsibility, so we have to work together."

the threat we face is daunting. but america has overcome big challenges many times before. throughout our history, we've stared into the face of evil and refused to blink. we beat fascism, won the cold war, brought osama bin laden to justice.

so no one should ever underestimate the determination of the american people. and i am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear. and we will defeat these new enemies, just as we've defeated those who've threatened us in the past.

because it is not enough to contain isis, we must defeat isis, break its momentum and then its back. and not just isis, but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al qaeda and offshoots like al shabaab in somalia.

now, waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership. but unfortunately, our political debate has been anything but serious.

we can't afford another major ground war in the middle east. that's exactly what isis wants from us. shallow slogans don't add up to a strategy. promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn't make you sound strong, it makes you sound like you're in over your head. bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming commander-in-chief.

and it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the treasury department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.

every day that's wasted on partisan gridlock could put americans in danger. so, yes, we need a serious discussion. and that's why in a speech last month before the council on foreign relations i laid out a three-part plan to defeat isis and the broader extremist movement.

one, defeat isis in the middle east by smashing its stronghold, hitting its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure from the air, and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground.

second, defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money, arms, propaganda, and fighters.

and third, defeat them here at home by foiling plots, disrupting radicalization, and hardening our defenses.

now, these three lines of effort reinforce one another. so we need to pursue all of them at once, using every pillar of american power.

it will require skillful diplomacy to continue secretary kerry's efforts to encourage political reconciliation in iraq and political transition in syria, enabling more sunni arabs and kurdish fighters to take on isis on both sides of the border, and to get our arab and turkish partners to actually step up and do their part.

it will require more u.s. and allied airpower, and a broader target set for strikes by planes and drones, with proper safeguards.

it will require special operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism missions.

what it will not require is tens of thousands of american combat troops. that is not the right action for us to take in this situation.

so there is a lot to do, and today, i want to focus on the third part of my plan, how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home.

we need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in san bernardino.

first, we have to shut down isis recruitment in the united states, especially online.

second, stop would-be jihadists from getting training overseas, and stop foreign terrorists from coming here.

third, discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out.

fourth, support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks.

and fifth, empower our muslim-american communities, who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization.

this is a 360-degree strategy to keep america safe, and i want to walk through each of the elements, from recruitment to training to planning to execution.

first, shutting down recruitment. we have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in-person and through social media, chat rooms, and what's called the "dark web."

to do that, we need stronger relationships between washington, silicon valley, and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs. american innovation is a powerful force, and we have to put it to work defeating isis.

that starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens. our security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze isis's social media posts and map jihadist networks, and they need help from the tech community.

companies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreements and other necessary policies to police their networks, identifying extremist content and removing it.

now, many are already doing this, and sharing those best practices more widely is important.

at the state department, i started an interagency center to combat violent jihadist messages, to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values, and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative.

we recruited specialists fluent in arabic, urdu, and somali to wage online battles with extremists to counter their propaganda.

now, those efforts have not kept pace with the threat, so we need to step up our game, in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government.

but that's just some of what we have to do. experts from the fbi, the intelligence community, homeland security, dod, the state department, and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat isis in cyberspace, using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory, just as we work to deny them actual territory.

and at the same time, we also have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization, whatever form it takes.

it's imperative that the saudis, the qataris, the kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools, madrassas and mosques around the world, once and for all, and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries.

now, second, we have to prevent isis recruits from training abroad, and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here.

most urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from europe and america to iraq and syria, and then back home again.

the united states and our allies need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip, and then share information with each other in real time.

right now, european nations don't always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen. they have to dramatically improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation. and we're ready to help them do that.

we also need to take down the network of enablers who help jihadists finance and facilitate their travel, forge documents, and evade detection. and the united states and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join isis or other groups, and bring the full force of law against them.

as i've said before, the united states has to take a close look at our visa programs. and i am glad the administration and congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of san bernardino. and that should include scrutinizing applicants' social media postings. we also should dispatch more homeland security agents to high-risk countries to better investigate visa applicants.

for many years, america has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures, including key allies in europe and asia. that makes sense. but we also have to be smart. except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers, anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation, no matter where they're from.

we also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals. rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.

but congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process.

and just as important, we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations.

turning away orphans, applying a religious test that discriminates against muslims, slamming the door on every single syrian refugee; that is not who we are. we are better than that.

it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones.  so after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing syria just as the twin cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees, exiles, and immigrants.

of course, the key is to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security. but we can do this. and i think we must.

third, we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out. this is going to take better intelligence collection, analysis, and sharing. i've proposed an "intelligence surge" against isis that includes more operations officers and linguists, enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets, intercepting terrorist communications, flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorists' movements, and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services.

president obama recently signed the usa freedom act, which was passed by a bipartisan majority in congress. it protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe. however, the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right. some would strip away crucial counterterrorism tools, even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight. others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past.

i don't think we can afford to let either view prevail. now, encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties. law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. on the other hand, there are very legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit.

i know there's no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns. but we can't just throw up our hands. the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists.  and even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we also make sure jihadists don't get the tools they need to carry out attacks.

it defies common sense that republicans in congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns. if you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun, period.  and we should insist on comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows. and i think it's time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.

i know this will drive some of our republican friends a little crazy. you'll probably hear it tonight. they will say that guns are a totally separate issue, nothing to do with terrorism. well, i have news for them, terrorists use guns to kill americans. and i think we should make it a lot harder for them from to do that ever again.

and there's a question, a question they should be asked: why don't the republican candidates want to do that?   you see, i have this old fashioned idea that we elect a president in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. and i'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.

now, the fourth element in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.

in san bernardino, city, county, state, and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life. like detective jorge lozano, a 15-year police veteran, who assured terrified civilians, "i'll take a bullet before you do." there is no limit to the gratitude we owe to law enforcement professionals like that detective lozano who run toward danger to try to save lives. and not just in the immediate wake of an attack. our police, firefighters, and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on.

it's disgraceful that congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of 9/11. many of them were men and women i was so proud to represent as a senator from new york. the zadroga 9/11 health act never should have been allowed to lapse. it looks like majority leader mitch mcconnell may have finally dropped his opposition. and i hope the american people will hold him to that. and we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history.

we have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe. and they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts, including with better use of "fusion centers" that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination.

and we need to strengthen our defenses and our resilience wherever we're vulnerable, whether it's "soft targets" like shopping malls or higher-profile targets like airports, railways, or power plants. we have to build on the progress of the obama administration in locking down loose nuclear materials, and other wmd, so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world.

so we should be providing the department of homeland security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead, not trying to privatize key functions, like tsa, as some republicans have proposed.

and it's important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement, we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities, but that was an issue i tackled after 9/11, and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be.

finally, the fifth element in the strategy is empowering muslim-american communities who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization. there are millions of peace-loving muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in our country. these americans may be our first, last, and best defense against home grown radicalization and terrorism. they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, intervene to help set a young person straight. they are the best positioned to block anything going forward.

that's why law enforcement has worked so hard since 9/11 to build up trust and strong relationships within muslim-american communities.  here in the twin cities, you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents, teachers, imams, and others in the somali-american community with law enforcement, non-profits, local businesses, mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk.

it's called the building community resilience pilot program, and it deserves increased support. it has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do. and we've got to do a better job of supporting it.

now i know that like many places across the country, there's more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement. just last month, i know here a young african american man was fatally shot by a police officer. and i understand an investigation is underway. whatever the outcome, tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in america and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism.

when people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they're more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement. one of the mothers of the 10 men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said, "we have to stop the denial," she told other parents that. "we have to talk to our kids and work with the fbi." that's a message we need to hear from leaders within muslim-american communities across our country.

but we also want to highlight the successes in muslim american communities, and there are so many of them. i just met with the first somali-american council member of the city council here. and he was proudly telling me how much change somali immigrants, now muslim-americans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out. let's look at the successes.

if we're going to full integrate everyone into america, then we need to be seeing all their contributions, too. and that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful, anti-muslim rhetoric. you know, not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as americans, they are also dangerous.

as the director of the fbi told congress recently, anything that erodes trust with muslim-americans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult. we need every community invested in this fight, not alienated and sitting on the sidelines.

one of the community leaders i met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school. they're not only afraid of being perceived as a threat, they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are. this is such a open-hearted and generous community, i hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly governor dayton and others, to bring people together to reassure members of the community, particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome, invited and valued here in this city and state.

now donald trump's proposal to ban all muslims from entering the united states has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world. even some of the other republican candidates are saying he's gone too far. but the truth is, many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about muslims. and this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists. it alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against isis.

you know, you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions. everyone seems to want one. but there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work. i know how hard this is because i've done it. and i can tell you, insulting potential allies doesn't make it any easier.

and demonizing muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world, that the united states is at war with islam. as both the pentagon and the fbi have said in the past week, we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea. this is not a clash of civilizations. it's a clash between civilization and barbarism and that's how it must be seen and fought.

some will tell you that our open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. i disagree. i believe our tolerance and diversity are at the core of our strength. at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in washington, president obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger. it is, he said, about the meaning of america, what kind of country do we want to be? and it's about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding, e pluribus unum. out of many we are one.

president obama is right, and it matters. it's no coincidence that american muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than muslims in less welcoming countries.  we can't give in to demagogues who play on our basest instincts. we must instead rely on the principles written into our american dna. freedom. equality. opportunity.

america is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future, no matter where they're from, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love.  our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. as george washington put it, the united states gives "to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance." so to all our muslim-american brothers and sisters, this is your country too. and i am proud to be your fellow american.

and i want to remind us, particularly our republican friends, that george w. bush was right. six days after 9/11 he went to a muslim community center and here's what he said, those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don't represent the best of america, they represent the worst of human kind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.

so if you want to see the best of america, you need look no further than army captain humayun khan. he was born in the united arab emirates. he moved to maryland as a small child, and later graduated from the university of virginia, before enlisting in the u.s. army.

in june 2004, he was serving in iraq. one day, while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base, a suspicious vehicle appeared. captain khan told his troops to get back, but he went forward. he took ten steps toward the car before it exploded. captain khan was killed, but his unit was saved by his courageous acts. captain khan was posthumously awarded the bronze star and purple heart. he was just 27 years old.

"we still wonder what made him take those 10 steps," khan's father said in a recent interview.

"maybe that's the point," he went on, "where all the values, all the service to country, all the things he learned in this country kicked in. it was those values that made him take those 10 steps. those 10 steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country," his father finished.

as hard as this is, it's time to move from fear to resolve. it's time to stand up and say,

"we are americans." we are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we've faced, but because of them.  americans will not buckle or break.  we will not turn on each other or turn on our principles. we will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose. we will crush their would-be caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root.  we're in it for the long haul. and we'll stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine.

that's what we do here. it's who we are. that's how we'll win, by looking at one another with respect, with concern, with commitment. that's the america that i know makes us all so proud to be a part of.

thank you all very much. wow. thank you. thank you all. thank you. i am really delighted to be here on the first winter day of this season.

to be here in this beautiful city and church that has been the site of a lot of occasions. and especially to be introduced by brenda, who, as she said, i first met in a town hall in dover all those months ago.

and you know, when you call on people in town halls, as you'll see in a minute, you have no idea what they're going to say or what they are going to ask. and when i called on her, she basically said i have a husband with early onset alzheimer's, i have a mother with alzheimer's. i'm taking care of them. what are you going to do about alzheimer's?

and it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president i want to be. obviously, i want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs. and i want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face.

but i also want to be a president who works for families, like brenda's. who understands that the problems we keep you up at night are ones that we also have to take seriously. so, it means the world to me to have her support in this campaign.

and as i've said to her and to others who have raised issues with me during the course of my time here in new hampshire, i will do everything i can to try and find answers. you know, in alzheimer's, as she said, we have got five million people currently suffering. the projection is for many millions more.

it is the sixth leading cause of death in america. but unlike the other causes in the top ten, there is no real path to prevention or effective treatment, or a cure, as there is with other diseases that take so many lives.

so, my proposal is that we tackle all three of those. what can we do to try and prevent it? what can we do to try to more effectively treat it? and what would it take to invest in finding a cure? and after talking to experts, the leading experts in our country—not just in alzheimer's, but in other neurodegenerative diseases, like parkinson's, the overwhelming response was, if we invested just $2 billion more a year, we would make tremendous progress.

and we would have a real shot at understanding more about this disease and trying to cure it. and the heavens support what we are going to do on behalf of alzheimer's, and the patients, the families and the caregivers.

so, i want to thank my friend terry narelli , who i see here, for her great service and leadership over so many years, and for her friendship. and i want to just make a few other quick acknowledgments. and then we will move on to be ready for the questions.

the mayor. i want to thank the mayor. where is mayor lister? i saw him earlier. he's here somewhere. there he is. there he is. thank you so much, mayor. wonderful to see you, thank you for your support. and to the south church, thank you for letting us be here today.

and to the overflow, which i stopped by to see on my way here. it was packed. we thank you for your patience. they have got a big screen, they are having a good time watching. and we are delighted they are here as well.

as brenda said, on january 20, 2017, someone will raise a hand and take the oath of office, and become our 45th president. that person will, after being sworn in, and the celebrations that go with an inauguration, go into the white house, go into the oval office, and face the challenges that await.

this will be a consequential election in so many ways. because we have work to do. i'm excited about the work. i'm confident and optimistic about the work we can do together.

but i need all of you to be part of this campaign, to be part of the first in the nation primary, because in many ways, you are the first—or depending on how you define it, the last line of defense.

the decision that new hampshire makes is so important. and i've had a great time traveling across the state, meeting, by now, thousands and thousands of people. having a chance to set forth my ideas and answer questions on whatever might be on someone's mind.

and i know that we are going to make the right decision—not because my name will be on the ballot, but because all of us know what the stakes are, and how high they happen to be.

so i'm excited and very much looking forward to the sprint towards the primary and to have a chance to hear even more for more folks here in the granite state about what is on your mind, about the big economic challenges, the security issues, and all those problems they keep you up at night.

i have learned a lot listening to folks here in new hampshire. i learned a lot about the struggles, the opportunities, the disappointments. as you know, i have had two full town hall meetings just on the issue of substance abuse. when i made a list of what i was going to talk about in this campaign, it wasn't on that list.

but on my first trip here to new hampshire in keene, that was what was raised with me. and then on visit after visit, i was given mass cards showing the pictures of beautiful young people no longer with us because of overdoses. i met those in recovery, who thankfully, were able to get help when they needed it. i met grandmothers like myself, raising children because their children couldn't, lost to opioid addiction, heroin addiction. so that's why taking the big issue to me.

i will never stop leading with the values that i was raised with about who we are as americans, what we're capable of doing. i will never stop listening, learning about what's on people's minds. i think you actually learn more when you listen. and i will never stop trying to work with you to solve problems.

that's the america that i was raised in, that's the america that i think we all cherish and that's the america that i'm going to do everything i can as your president to make sure it's stronger and better and fairer for everybody going forward.

so let me now turn to all of you and if you raise your hand, i think we have some microphones somewhere that we will try to get to you and give you a chance. this young—this woman right there. yes, right there. yes. please stand up. great.

 hi. hi. this is such an honor. you look stunning and i've always wanted to talk with you.

i have been on your bandwagon since you were first lady. we are nine days apart, but i know why you look so much better, because you're younger.

but it's a dream come true to have this interaction. as a cancer survivor, three years ago and going through surgery, chemo, radiation, and having a job i loved, i was let go from my job in the private sector. however, i did come to redo myself as a justice of the peace in massachusetts and i work now with elderly through brookline council on aging.

and i have seen people up close and personal that are delights, as well as being able to hear them. and one of the issues i have heard lately is the hearing is a problem and that they cannot afford to buy hearing aids because they are thousands of dollars. as a senior myself now, the affordable health care for getting the supplements to medicare is an issue as well, because if you're not—if you're too far above $100, $200 above the guidelines for medicaid or mass health, then you cannot—you have to pay full prices to supplements, but the seniors are saying they need help in hearing.

 have any of you heard this before, that seniors who need help with hearing can't afford to get the hearing aids because the hearing aids are so expensive? this is something that...

i think a lot of people thought we would figure out a way to solve in the affordable care act, but we haven't yet, and it's something that i take really seriously because if you can't hear well, very often, people kind of withdrawal and they become more isolated, and in fact, some of the recent research shows that, you know, that can be a trigger for other kinds of conditions and diseases.

so i don't think hearing aids when you can't hear are a luxury, i think they're a necessity. and i'm going to do everything i can...

... to move—to move them from what would be the elective list to a supported list so that people who have financial problems will be able to get help to afford them because you're 100 percent right.

it's a growing concern, in part because we have a lot more people living longer and part because we have a lot more people losing their hearing earlier. some people say it's because of loud music that some of us remember listening to, but for whatever reason it might be, there are a lot of issues around it. so i'm going to do what i can to make sure we make hearing aids financially available on a sliding scale so more people who need them can actually get them.

yeah, this gentleman right there. yeah, right there in the yellow tie. here comes the microphone.

 good afternoon. my name is mr. rogers. i happen to be in your neighborhood.

i have a message for you; i'm from liberia. liberia, we elected the first female president in the continent of africa. you already talked about...

... your hand is raised up to take that oath. i'm here on behalf of the republic of liberia, from johnson-sirleaf the president of liberia, to say hi to you.

since 5 o'clock this morning—i don't know where i was going—i have to find my way here. but do me one favor. i want to take a picture with you and send it to her that i was here as i promised.

if you don't mind please. if you don't mind.

 we will do that when we finish. don't let me forget, and i have a feeling you won't.

but the president of liberia, ellen johnson-sirleaf, who has been elected twice—as you rightly say, the first woman president anywhere on the continent of africa—has been...

... has been an extraordinary leader. i mean, she inherited an economy and a government that was bankrupt. they had had this terrible long civil war that had just destroyed so much of the productive capacity in addition to taking so many lives and leaving so many maimed and injured people behind, and a lot of liberians left liberia because of the lack of safety.

she has been, i think, incredibly focused on trying to improve the government, improve the economy. then she was dealt the terrible blow of ebola and all that it meant to her country. and i want to tell you just a quick story because it's good to remember how important it is to keep trying to work with people even if you have serious disagreements with them.

i went to visit president sirleaf when i was secretary of state and got a big briefing from all of her top officials about what was happening in her government and what they were trying to accomplish, and then i was supposed to go speak to the parliament, their congress. and she took me aside and she said i want you to go and speak about how hard democracy is, how hard we must work together, how we have to move past the past and then said to me some of the very people who are now in the parliament were people who were very much involved in the civil war and some of the terrible things that happened there.

the leaders went to war crimes tribunal, but others for whom there wasn't evidence or they played minor roles were actually elected. well, you can imagine. so i go to the parliament and i speak about democracy and all the rest of it and take some pictures and do some visits afterwards, and i thought boy, we think we have it hard, here she is trying to work with a congress that includes people who were mortal enemies with one another against her, against others, and she's working so hard to make this democracy what it should be against tremendous odds.

so when we complain about our problems here in this country, we need to put them into some perspective and we need to figure out how we're going to work together even with people we disagree with...

... going into the future. so thank you. we'll take a picture, i promise. ok, we've got this young lady in the red. yeah. and then i'll go further back to...

 thank you so much for being here and taking my question.

i am the mother of a 16-year-old boy who is smart and beautiful, but he also really struggles with mental illness and he's currently in an in-patient program right now. and i think my family, i think anyone would agree that my family has incredibly great health insurance. and i know that mental health parity is the law. but we still have to fight for every single admission, every single bit of treatment that we have asked for him—that the experts, his doctors who know him well all agree that this is what he needs to get better. and the health insurance company constantly tries to whittle it down and only provide the minimum amount.

and, you know, as a parent with a sick child, i only have so much energy to fight this fight and something just really needs to be done.

 how many of you know somebody with mental health problems?

how many of you know how difficult it is to get the medical care you need to help somebody with mental health problems?

what—what you're describing is exactly the case. we passed a law—i remember voting for it back in the day—and then there was another law passed and it was incorporated in the affordable care act, for what they call parity for mental health. in other words, if you have a physical illness, whatever it might be, you're supposed to get treated for it. if you have a mental health illness, you need to get treated for that, too.

number one, we need finally to remove the stigma from mental health, because...

... too often i hear from parents who say, "i no longer even tell people that my son has schizophrenia; my daughter is bipolar; my child has got, you know, chronic depression, because i feel like i'm judged." no. we're learning more about how the brain operates. that's one of the things we want to do. that's part of what my goal is for alzheimer's research. we have to understand the brain. we have to unlock its secrets. i really applaud president obama for the investment in the brain project that his administration has made.

so we need to remove the stigma and we need to enforce the law so you get the quality and the number of treatments you need, whether it's out-patient or in-patient. and i'm going to work with the mental health community, which has laid out an agenda about how we get this right once and for all, because it's not fair. it's not fair to the person suffering and it's certainly not fair to the families who are trying to cope with that suffering and get the medical care that is needed.

so i'll do everything i can to make it somewhat easier for you and your son going forward.

yes, this young man right here.

 when you become president...

 when you become president, what is your plan to connect mental health problems and guns to make sure that me, my brothers and my friends are safe from violence at school?

 oh, wow.

i'm going to do everything i can do. and i'm never going to stop trying. because right now, we lose 90 people a day to gun violence—homicides, suicides and tragic avoidable accidents. that's 33,000 people a year. i think we need to pass the laws that i have been advocating for. we need comprehensive background checks. we need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole.

and we need to make sure that the information that is needed to make the judgment about whether someone is qualified to buy a gun is in the record. and very often, we don't have real-time information because we also have to close what's called the charleston loophole, where the killer in charleston went to buy a gun. he filled out the form. under the loophole, he could come back and get it after three business days. the information that he wasn't eligible because he had a felony conviction didn't come through until after he went—used that gun and murdered nine people in a church like this in charleston.

so we have work to do. and the mental health piece of this is especially troubling, because you don't want to unfairly stigmatize people, but you want to protect the community, so you've got to have information. the killer at virginia tech, you might remember, had been committed. but that information was not in the records.

we need to prohibit people who are drastic abusers with restraining orders against them from getting guns. and we certainly should get the congress to prohibit anyone who is on the no-fly list, the would-be terrorists, from buying guns in america. and...

 ... and we need to repeal the immunity from liability that was given to gun makers and sellers by the congress...

... so that we can do as good a job as possible trying to prevent people who shouldn't have guns in the first place from getting them. and i know we can do this in a constitutionally consistent way.

so i'm going to reach out. i'll work with anybody, but i will also continue to advocate for this, because we are in a whole different era, where these mass shootings, these 33,000 people killed every year, has become a rebuke to us, that we can't figure—figure out how to deal with this. and i, personally, am asking gun owners to support these changes. because right now, what i just outlined—comprehensive background checks and the like—is supported by 92 percent of americans and 85 percent of gun owners. but the gun lobby lives off of fear and misinformation and is willing to say and do whatever it takes...

 and it is really time for gun owners to form a different organization that will do more on gun safety, do more on gun responsibility, and stand up for the safety of our children and our communities.

 ok. this gentleman with the cap on has been standing up. so why—why don't you ask the next question, sir?

 thank you so much, hillary. first and foremost, i want to say that i love you.

and i really mean it.

and so—my name is james mackey , i'm a community organizer for a non-profit organization called teen empowerment. and what we do is we hire young people to talk about issues, and we create initiatives around those issues to build relationships with young people in the community.

and so, i work in boston, dorchester, roxbury, mattapan, all the—all the...

... thank you. all the communities that are underserved. and so my question to you is, is that—so we just lost one of our youth organizers, two days ago, from a tragic accident. and there are 5.6 million young people around our nation who are 16 to 24, who are disconnected from school as well as from work.

and when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? and—and plus, they're in underserved communities. and so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? and what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? yeah.

 thank you. thank you. and first of all, thank you for being an organizer and reaching out to young people. that is so important. and...

... i hope you heard what he said, because think about this number: 5.6 million young people between 16 and 24, who are neither in school nor at work. that is a recipe for unemployment, for incarceration, for all kinds of behavior that has bad consequences for themselves and for their families.

and it's something i care deeply about, because if you look at where we are, underserved communities have had a resurgence of poverty. inner-cities, old suburbs, small towns and rural areas, native american reservations, coal country, this is across america where we have disconnected young people from a path to a productive life.

and i think we've got to figure out how we rebuild that. so i am absolutely committed and i am going to say quickly three things. i want to support programs like what you described you do, because we've got to get people in the communities—it's literally a one on one project in many cases.

what is it that can be done for john or mary or whomever? so we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. but secondly, we have to take a hard look. and one of the ideas that i have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems.

and we really have to figure out what works. people have tried a whole bunch of different things, and a lot of it doesn't work. throwing money at it doesn't necessarily work. building relationships is the work that has to be done. how do we do that?

i don't think the answer lies in washington, although as president, i can be a convener, a coordinator, a catalyst. i think we have to do this in communities. and i want to provide support and resources, where possible, to give more people a chance to do that relationship building.

we are going to need more ged programs very we need more community college programs. we are going to need more apprenticeship programs. we're going to need more pathways out. and we are going to have to also take a hard look at the living conditions and the schooling conditions that a lot of these kids face.

i used to have what i would call the chelsea test, when i would go into the school. and as the first lady in arkansas, the first lady in the united states or the senator in new york, i would walk into a school and i would spend some time, i would look around. i would look at the physical facilities, i'd talk to the staff area and i would say, would i want my daughter to go to the school?

a lot of times the answer was yes, absolutely. a lot of time the answer was no. some of the conditions, the physical conditions in these schools was deplorable. and then you have to look at the housing that a lot of people are living in. a lot of this housing is really substandard but in dangerous ways. and i will just end with this.

lead paint poisoning effects many, many children in the northeast, the mid-atlantic, and the midwest, where we had a lot of old housing. where we have old pipes on water supplies. lead poisoning is an academic and behavioral deficits inducement. people end up being worse off. and we are not doing enough to notice it, to deal with it, to eradicate it.

so there's a lot i think we have to take a hard look at. and i will do that. but it will be in partnership with young people like you and the groups you recognize and represent. thank you.

 i see a hand way back there. yes, yes. black and white, yes. right there. yes.

 thank you, secretary clinton. it is an honor. i'm from alabama and i know it is important for candidates to focus on undecided voters in swing states. but for liberals and conservatives states, we sometimes feel left out of the fray.

and i would hope that the democratic party and your campaign will go into those conservative states and really push and give us hope and encouragement that your platforms will be heard there. and i ask you, please don't leave us to the republicans.

 well, i have been down to alabama twice already in this campaign. and i will do my best to help rebuild the democratic party in places where it hasn't been particularly successful in recent years. because i think there is a lot we can recommend. i really do.

i think that our view about what we need to do to get the economy going again, and fix all the problems that we see with the affordable care act, and get early childhood education—you know, there is a very inconvenient fact that my republican friends hate when i mention. but it is true. our economy does better when we have a democrat in the white house.

and that is true in alabama, just like it's true anywhere. and we are going to make that case, do the very best we can to kind of get people to recognize that we are all in this together. and getting the economy to work better, getting our government to be more effective and productive in producing results, building on the progress that president obama made it—remember, he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great recession.

and then he had to make sure it didn't fall into a great depression. i don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure that did not happen.

so, we are going to make that case. we are going to make that case throughout the country. i hope, effectively. at least, i'm counting on that. yes, the man in the blue vest. yeah, yeah.

 this is an honor. i'm a retired teacher from massachusetts. i've never been involved in any political aspects. i've—we are about the same age, actually, hillary. so, it's only—i respect one woman in my life, which is my wife.

you are the no. 2 woman i respect more than any woman on this planet. i have watched you since your—you know, your early political days. we are both grandparents of very young grandchildren. i'm a little bit nervous here.

but i just wanted to tell you that there is one thing that has—in the minds of most people—we have doubt. we have doubt about so many things that we've hoped for, and we've seen evolve.

you eliminate doubt for someone like me. you eliminate doubt. i have—your knowledge and your grasp of what's happening, and what you've been through, and what you see—and things that you know that we don't know are what make me feel confident that you were going to be the next president.

thank you. thank you. there is a little hand right there, that little girl right there. i like having all of these young people here.

 hi. hi, i'm ella. i think that there is a lot of people who don't have enough money for college, and schools and that kind of stuff. so, how can we help that?

 it's a very good question, ella.

that is a great question. how many people have student debt, or ever had student debt? guess that's nearly everybody here, practically. look, i think there are two things, two big things we have to do. first, i want to make college debt-free, so that you don't have to borrow money for tuition to go to a four-year public college or university.

and it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. because i do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on.  so, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. i think states have dis-invested in higher education. a lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it.

so, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. i think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. i think that's only fair. and i want students to work 10 hours a week. because i want students to know they are working for their education. and that it's something they really value.

and i want to do more on national service so more students get big discounts because they will have done national service. military service, civilian service.

and we've got a good g.i. bill now coming after 9/11—a new g.i. bill for the new generation of vets, but i want to make sure they don't get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don't really serve them well. so we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right.

and then i want to help you pay down your debt by refinancing your debt. just like you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you ought to be able to refinance your college debt.

and it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostly—we've had really low interest rates. and yet, when i ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. some of it private, some of it to the government. and i do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education.

so we're going to—we're going to make a lot of changes, ella. so certainly by the time you get there, but hopefully sooner, we will have a lot of good changes that you'll be able to take advantage of.

yes. there's a lady right here and maybe—let's see. here comes the microphone. right there.

 thank you for coming to portsmouth. i was very disappointed in the last debate that the international agreement on climate that was agreed upon in paris was not even mentioned. so could you comment on that and tell us as president, what you would do?

 yes. i happen to think the...

the paris agreement was a historic achievement and i give a lot of credit to president obama's leadership because if the united states had not led, it would not have happened, and i know how hard it was, because president obama and i went to the big international climate meeting in copenhagen in 2009. and literally, we could not even get a meeting with the chinese, the indians, the south africans and the brazilians.

led by the chinese, who did not want to have a meeting with us where they might make a commitment to actually doing anything. and so we had to chase them around this big convention center in copenhagen, and we finally found them. chinese guards were preventing the entry in and the president is a lot taller than i am, and so he just kind of pushed through in the hands went up so i ducked under and we got in the room.

and then, you know, the president says, "we've been looking all over for you." we pulled up chairs and we sat down and we said, "you know, look, we have to begin this process." and their argument was the typical argument. "we didn't cause the problem. it was the developed countries." we said, "look, that's fine, but you are now the biggest emitters and you are going to have to help solve the problems," and they began to agree to do some internal accounting and public reporting.

fast forward from '09, we had a series of climate meetings in cancun and durban, and we made progress. so the agreement coming out of paris does, for the first time, include every nation, regardless of level of development or need or threat from climate change.

and now, we have to enforce it. so as president, i would do everything i can, using every tool that i had to hold other nations accountable, including our own, about what we need to do both to try desperately to move more quickly away from fossil fuels towards clean, renewable energy, to try to at least put a cap on temperature rise and emissions and try the best we can at the same time to do more on resilience and adaptation to try and help countries and parts of countries that are particularly at risk.

portsmouth is the seacoast city. you all—i know the mayor and everybody, you're working hard on resilience and you're really taking a hard look, but you need a partner in washington and in the congress, as well as the president. there are a lot of places in our country—alaska has already been hit hard. they've had to relocate some villages from the coastline. i know that miami is really facing some big challenges.

so we've got to get serious about this because it's happening. we are seeing the results of this drastic increase in temperature that human activity has not just contributed to, but caused. so, it's time for us to...

... deal with the problem, but i believe it's also a great opportunity. and this is what i have a hard time understanding from my republican counterparts. you know, they all are into denial and when asked about climate change typically will say well i don't know, i'm not a scientist. you know, the answer to that is go talk to one...

... and listen to what the scientists tell you, and...

... so from my perspective, we have economic opportunities here that we're leaving on the table. we can do so much more, putting people to work in wind, in solar, in advanced biofuels. we can make a difference in the economy with new, good-paying jobs. and i will say this. you know, when i'm not in new hampshire, i'm often in iowa. iowa now produces one-third of its electricity from renewables, predominantly wind.

seven thousand people now work in the wind industry. they are now assembling turbines in old, abandoned factories, they are educating young people in the community colleges to actually work on these turbines. so they have gone the whole supply chain, and good for them. every state should be doing the same. every state has that same economic potential here...

... and when we—when we let politics, really politics that are under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry—and in particular, the koch brothers—decide the future of our country, shame on us. we're better than that, we're smarter than that, and we all—republican, democrat, independent, whatever—we all need to say we are taking on this challenge and we're going to make jobs and incomes rise because of it. that to me is the right approach for us to be taking.

oh my goodness. so many hands, so little time. well, you're standing right there. why don't we go with that lady right there. yeah.

 hi, thank you. i've spent a lot of time teaching art in women's prisons, and the majority of the women i've worked with are from minority, low-income families and the majority of them are in their second, third, fourth visits to prison, and they say it's easier to just live in that cycle than try to break out of it. how would you approach helping end that cycle?

 first of all, thank you for working in our prisons. you know, we are still in the midst of the holiday season, and for those of us who celebrate christmas, it's good to remember that we are called upon to care for the homeless and the stranger and the prisoner, the refugee.

those are important reminders at a time when there's so much political dispute about all of this, and i think we have incarcerated too many people. we have 5 percent of the world's population...

... but 25 percent of the prison population, and we actually have one-third of women who are imprisoned anywhere in the world imprisoned in the untied states. so we have to begin in a thoughtful way to deal with the effects of incarceration.

obviously, from my perspective, we need to take a hard look at the low-level, non-violent offenses for which people end up incarcerated. we have to take a hard look at our bail system because we have too many people in jail and prison who haven't even been tried yet. we don't know if they're guilty of anything other than poverty because they can't meet the bail that has been set for them. and we need to do a careful analysis of who can and should be released from prison while we try to deal with people who don't pose a threat to the community, particularly the numbers of people with low-level drug offenses who need treatment, not imprisonment. and so we've got to look at all of this and...

... yet, i don't think that's enough, and it goes back to the gentleman's question over there in the hat. the issue is, ok, if we're going to divert people from prison, what are the things we're going to do?

well, i'm a big believer in drug courts, i think drug courts are a much better option than imprisoning people. they should be given recovery, they should be held accountable. i believe that there are more programs that are cheaper and better.

and i want to just quickly tell you about a program i visited in reno, nevada. and it was a program originally started for alcoholics—people that were found on the street and were picked up, taken to jail. a month later, they'd be on the street again, taken to jail, or maybe they'd end up being put into an ambulance, taken to the emergency room, maybe admitted. a month or two later, back on the street.

so, a really great partnership between the county sheriff's office and catholic charities said, "there's gotta be a better way. first of all, it's really expensive to jail and imprison people." so they built a facility that had small bedrooms, that had work to be done, that offered this option to people they were picking up, saying, "you can either go back to jail, back to—you know, the life you've had, or you can try this."

and they got enough people to try it. they tested them three times a day to make sure they weren't cheating. and the sheriff said to me—he said, "you know—want to know the best thing about this?" he said, "because i can—i can justify this anywhere."

he said the first year, the sheriff's office and the hospital and the jail saved $4 million, because they were no longer putting people in high, intensive places like jails and emergency rooms.

now they're moving on to drug addiction, because we've got to think differently about how to help people overcome the problems that they confront. and i just don't think jail is a place for people with substance abuse or mental health problems. and therefore, we need different approaches...

... that will be actually better and cheaper. so let's—let's try to figure out how we're gonna do that, too.

this young man.

 hi. i have a dad that works for people with developmental disabilities. and i have an uncle with autism. and i was wondering, what are some of the ways that you can help people with disabilities and people with special needs that need help?

 great question. you know, thanks.

thank you dad for us, too, ok? is your dad here? thanks, dad.

yeah. people with disabilities—you know, i was very proud that the united states became the first nation in the world to open schools to people with disabilities. and it was the—i worked on that, when i was with the children's defense fund. and we went door to door, asking people, "do you have a school-age child who's not in school?"

and we found a blind kids and kids in wheelchairs and kids with behavioral problems, and then gave all that data to the congress, and the congress acted, and schools were opened. and then the—the americans with disabilities act was passed, another great accomplishment. a bipartisan accomplishment that really made a huge difference.

so now we have to do more to make sure that we provide supportive housing, that we support families. the biggest concern people talk to me about when they have children with disabilities, and particularly with autism, is what happens when they are no longer there to take care of their children, and how will that work out.

i'm actually rolling out a plan about autism in about a week, where i talk about all the different things...

... that we need to do to try to support families and people who are diagnosed as on the autism-spectrum disorders.

how many of you know somebody with autism? wow. wow. well, you know, the latest data from the centers on disease control is that -you know, 1 out of 68 children have some feature that would place them on the autism spectrum.

so that's something we need to deal with. so we're—we'll be addressing that. but i guess my bottom line would be we—we, as communities, need to support families and need to support people with disabilities so that they can go as far as their talent, their hard work, their skills will take them.

and i think there are a lot of opportunities that we're just learning about that we can apply, and that i will talk about when i roll this out.

i've just been told this is my last question. and so—oh, my goodness. this is totally—i should not have said that. this is totally, totally unfair. oh my gosh. i—i ...

 here! here!

 you—ok. so you've got promoters right here. this young man, right there? ok. you got a whole team here that is—is giving you a chance. go ahead. because i really do love to call on kids, because that's what this election is actually all about, is their future.

 my name is relic riley. i'm from massachusetts, and my mother over there is complaining that she does not get much more money than my father. my mother is an...

my mother is an engineer. i meant teacher. my father's the engineer. and i—i think that my mother is working more harder than my...

i don't know my grammar. i just don't know my grammar.

i think my mother isn't working much harder—is working more harder than my father, and she deserves to have more money.

like, get more money than my father.

because she's taking care of children, and—i just don't think it's fair.

 that is really so sweet.

 i—you have a great future as an advocate, and—look, i—i do think equal pay for equal work is still a problem. and i think the paycheck fairness act, which i supported every year it came up when i was in the senate, is really important to try to open up the—the pay arena to more transparency.

because right now, if you are doing a job, and you ask how much somebody else makes, you can be fired or retaliated against. and how are we ever gonna know that we get fair pay for—you know, not just women, although that's the biggest discrepancy, but particularly people who are in—you know, positions where it's hard to ask for more, because of their—you know, their working conditions.

i had a young man here in new hampshire tell me the reason he was supporting me is because i was in favor of equal pay. and when i asked him why, he said because he got his first grown-up adult job when he was 17, and he went to work in the same store where his mother had worked—that's how he got the job—and, his first pay period, brought his paycheck home, he showed his mother, and he watched her face fall.

and he asked her why, and she said, "you're making more now than i am making after four years on the same job." and i said to him—i said, so what was the reason? i mean, how—how did this add up?

he said, "you know, i tried to find out," and he said, "basically the manager said, 'well, we like to identify young men who can go far in the company, and so we want to give you the incentive to stay and maybe get into one of our training programs.'"

and i really—this young man was very touching. he said, "but they never asked my mom, and she's much more organized than i am."

so i think that we still have problems, and if you deny those problems, you are denying the fastest way to increase incomes in america. and that is to make sure women are paid what they deserve in the job that they do.

thank you all, very much. thank you. oh, thank you all so much. thank you. oh, you are great. thank you.

oh, my goodness. i'll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. you have been so generous with your time. and i'm just so grateful to be back in marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on monday night. but it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and i really am grateful to each and every one of you.

i've learned a lot in the last months, and i really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president. so i thank you for everything you've done to make that possible.

and i really want to thank mark smith for his endorsement. i'm thrilled. thank you so very much, representative. and i have a—i have a plan that i hope will come to pass when it—that affects mark. and that is i hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the house of representatives in the state legislature.

think of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across iowa.

well, it's getting close. and when all of you decide to go caucus on monday, you're going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country.

and i know how seriously iowans take this because i've been talking with you and listening to you. but i want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time.

when you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. well, i will tell you where i stand.

i believe that the republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we've made, and undermine our future. and that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. let's take the economy.

you heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. we have tried that, it does not work. and it's important to know the facts. and the facts are that our economy does better when we have a democrat in the white house who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for americans.

and the last two democratic presidents we've had, both of whom i know, which i kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their republican predecessors.

you know, in my husband's case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. so when he got to washington, people said, "ok. so, what do you especially bring to washington that can make a difference?" he said, "well, i guess i bring arithmetic. we're going to make it add up again for the american people." and at the end of eight years, we did.

twenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. more people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. and we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. we were on the right track.

well, back came the republicans and back came trickle-down economics. george w. bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on wall street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face.

now we know what happened, don't we? we went into the greatest financial crisis since the great depression, and when barack obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. i don't think president obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the republicans put us in during their administration.

and it was not easy. i know; i talked to him about it. when he asked me to be secretary of state, he said, "we got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world."

and what did he do? well, we're back on track with 14 million new jobs. the affordable care act was passed. we're now at 90 percent health care coverage in america for the first time.

he passed and signed the toughest regulations on wall street since the 1930s, the dodd-frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. we ended up losing 9 million because of that great recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.

now, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again. in fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in america when you have a republican in the white house.

so the economy is going to be at the core of this election. so you should ask everybody who's running what they're going to do about it. and i got to tell you, i'm proud of what we've been doing on the democratic side. we have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that's what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the republicans.

so i've put out a plan. here is what i think we need to do. we need more infrastructure jobs. our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. we have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive.

and then we're going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. we're going to reverse that so we start investing in america again, advance manufacturing. i know it can be done because i've been to some of your community colleges. i have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on.

i also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs. and that will be a huge economic opportunity——that is directly linked to what iowa has been doing.

you know, the republicans, when you ask them about climate change, they all say the same thing. "well, i don't know, i'm not a scientist." you know, there's an easy way to remedy that. go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what's going on. and, you know, that's bad enough that they're into denial. what really is troubling is they're missing this huge economic opportunity.

and when i tell people that, i see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here's what i tell them. i know we can create those jobs because look at what iowa has done.

and i want you to thank representative smith. thank you. and it started with tom vilsack and the democrats making a commitment. iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind.

you have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. you are doing research on advanced biofuels that the defense department thinks may be able to fuel navy vessels and air force planes. so iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. it's either going to be china, germany, or us. i want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we're going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world.

we also need to be focusing on small business because that's where most of the jobs come from in america. and i want to be the small business president. my dad was a small businessman, so i want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again. and especially young people. s lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit. part of it is they have such student debts they can't get credit; we've got to fix that. so we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business.

now, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. one, we've got to raise the minimum wage. people who work full time should not still be in poverty.

there should be a ladder of opportunity. and the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women's work, and that will raise incomes and families will be better off, the economy will be.

now, everything i've just said to you the republicans don't agree with it, every bit of it. they don't believe in any of it. they don't really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want. well, that's not going to work. we know it won't, and we can't be sold that bill of goods again.

the other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer. and i'm am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge. i will raise your incomes, i will not raise middle-class taxes. i do not think it is right——to be going to people who suffered because of the republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. i want you to take advantage of them, but i want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that's where we need to be shifting our tax system. so we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the "carried interest loophole" that i've been against for years.

we also need to do what warren buffett suggested. i was really very happy that he endorsed me, and i went to omaha with him. and we were standing there and he——he said, you know, i'm not too popular among my rich friends these days because i think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country. and he has something he calls the buffett rule. anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate. so i've adopted the buffett rule and we're going to go right at it and try to get that done.

and then i want to go further, i want to impose what i call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more. now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because i want to use that money to make college affordable. i want to use that money to invest in clean energy. i want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. i want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. there are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it.

now, people say to me, "well, how are we ever going to get that done?" well, i do have a political strategy. i've seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. there are not that many people who make $5 million or more in america, and i think we can make a very clear case.

mr. congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?

we're going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer. you know, you can talk about it, but i have a plan to do it. not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because i want you to know what i aim to do for you and what it will cost you. and i want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment.

i also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after wall street.

now, i totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, senator sanders and governor o'malley, that we've got to keep our eyes on the big banks. and no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. but we already have the authority to go after them. that was in the dodd-frank bill. we don't have to do that, we just have to implement it. and i have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, i will go after them and i will use the process president obama signed into law.

but here's where i differ with my two friends—that is not enough. and this is what we've been arguing about on the debate stage. you see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like lehman brothers. it was a big insurance conglomerate called aig. it was a mortgage company called countrywide. it was another bank, not one of the big five, called wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector.

so what i've is we're going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. and paul krugman, the nobel prize-winning economist, said i have the best plan. barney frank, who is actually the frank in dodd-frank, said i have the best plan because i'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future.

and you know, the best evidence i have that i have the best plan is that the republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. you know, it started a few weeks ago. these two hedge fund billionaires formed a super pac to run ads against me to convince democrats not to support me. and then along came karl rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he's now running an ad against me. and now another billionaire has jumped in, and he's now running an ad against me.

now you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince democrats not to support me? well, i think you know the answer, because they know that i say what i mean, i do what i say i will do, and i know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from——pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy.

now, another area where i have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as senator sanders is health care. you know, i believe in universal health care coverage. every american should have it. you know, before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare back in '93 and '94 when i was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. and that was really disappointing.

i mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. so we didn't succeed. and then i got to thinking, well, what can i do now? because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. the real question is whether you get back up. so i started thinking, what can i do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives.

and i remembered when i was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn't afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn't give it to them. and i met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. and i remember i was at the children's hospital in cleveland. i was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. and one man said to me, he said, "you know, i've gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. i have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me."

i said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? they say no. he said, i'll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company i visited. he said, we don't insure burning houses. this man said, they called my little girls burning houses. and that stuck with me, that and the stories i heard. so i started to work with democrats and republicans and we created the children's health insurance program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get——you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going. you can't ever stop if you're trying to accomplish something that will help other people. and i was thrilled when the president passed and signed the affordable care act.

we've been trying to get that—the democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since harry truman. and now, i meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. i want to build on it and i want to improve it. you know, the republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the white house back. we can't let that happen.

here is what i want to do. i want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs.

i want to make sure that we get the authority for medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. i want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. i want to take away their tax benefits. they actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on tv to us that we never—i can't understand what they're talking about.

they have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. they have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. and then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. i mean, it——drives you crazy. and they spend more money advertising on tv than they spend on research. so we're going to go right at them. we're going to take them on on this.

but i don't want to start over, my friends. that's the disagreement i have with senator sanders. i want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of americans. i don't want to start at zero and have to——fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. so i'm determined that we're going to make this work for everybody, and i know it's the right thing to do. and i hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again.

i also will defend social security against privatization. the republicans still want to privatize it. they're still talking about that. it's a terrible idea. and you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire social security trust fund over to wall street. that's what this is all about. take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to wall street. i will never let that happen. that is the worst——idea that is imaginable.

i will also not let them voucherize medicare, something else they want to do, and i will not let them privatize the va. we have to fix the va, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. that's not going to happen.

and when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, i think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and i have some ideas that i've been putting out based on what i did in the senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of state.

it's imperative that we do everything we can to defeat isis, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the internet where they're quite effective without putting american troops back on the ground in either syria or iraq.

that will not happen. it's not—it's not going to happen on my watch. and then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks.

when i was a senator after 9/11, i'd be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing new york, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. but, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, if you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. and so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the fbi, and it really provided kind of the—the eyes-on help that we needed. and people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. we foiled attacks.

well, the reason i mention that is because of this. the republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking muslims, right? you've heard that, attacking american muslims, attacking muslims around the world. that's not only shameful, it's dangerous. we need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks.

and we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. and certainly, if we're going to defeat isis, we need a coalition that includes muslim nations.

now, i can tell you i built the coalition that imposed sanctions on iran. i know a little bit about how you do this. you don't start by insulting people's religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary.

that's not the way it works in the real world. so we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority.

i also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which i think is in the best interest of our country and our economy.

and i want to let you know where i stand on a lot of the issues that the republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that i support.

i am for a woman's right—a woman's right to make her own health decisions, and i am against defunding planned parenthood.

i am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the lgbt community. i am against citizens united, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the koch brothers and others. and i would do everything i can to reverse that decision.

i also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. and i want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep—  —americans safe without infringing on gun owners' rights.

we are a smart—we are a smart people. we can do this. and what i don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to bible study. we can do this. we can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.

and 92 percent of the american people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. so we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country.

so we have a lot of work to do, my friends. and you have been really patient. the children who are still here have been especially patient, and i don't want to keep you any longer.

i just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, i will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions. but everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because i need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next monday.

and, you know, i am all about—i am all about making progress against the odds. i am all about working with people. i worked with republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of state. i worked to get results for the people i represented in the senate as well as our country. i worked when i was secretary of state to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. and i know how to find common ground because i've done it.

i don't think that—i think i—i do believe that probably every republican i served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. actually, when i'm not running for something, they say nice things about me.

even in the case of mr. trump, they give me money because they think i'm so good as a candidate and a senator. so, you know, this is politics. this is all that that goes on.

but once the election is over, i will work as hard as i can to find that common ground, to get good things to happen for you, for your families, for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like i felt, that, you know, really the american dream was available. you had to work for it, but if you did, you could get ahead and stay ahead. that's what i think about when it comes to my granddaughter. you know, i am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. i think it shouldn't matter. the grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country.

and that's what i am going to stand up for and fight for. and with your help, starting at the caucus next monday night, that's what we will do together. thank you all so much. wow! what a night. an unbelievable night. what a great campaign. this has been an incredible honor to campaign across iowa, with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want.

for the democratic party and for the united states of america. there is so much at stake in this election, i don't need to tell you. every single one of you who came out for me, who worked so many hours — from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state — i am deeply grateful.

i love all of you. here's what i want you to know. it is rare that we have the opportunity we do now, to have a real contest of ideas. to really think hard about what the democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.

i am a progressive who gets things done for people. i am honored to stand in the long line of american reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough. that standing still is not an option. and that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of americans. i look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job i had at the children's defense fund. and i know. i know what we are capable of doing, i know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking americans again. i know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.

i know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. i know we can make our education system work for every one of our children, especially those who come with disadvantages. i know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people. and i know we can protect our rights, women's rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrant rights, workers rights. i know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures.

and how do we do that? we do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that white house as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as americans.

i congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; i wish governor o'malley the very best. he is a great public servant who has served maryland and our country and i am excited about really getting into the debate with senator sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and america. in the last few weeks, we finally began to have what i think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the democratic party could have. and i am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that.

i know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals. but i believe we have a very clear idea that the democratic party and this campaign stands for what is best in america. and we have to be united. when it is all said and done, we have to be united.

a republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us. that is not who we are, my friends. i follow their candidates very closely, i understand what they're appealing to, and i intend to stand against it. i will not — i will not let their decisiveness, their efforts to rip away the progress that we've made, be successful. because we can't afford that. as i stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, iowa. i want you to know, i will keep doing what i have done my entire life.

i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you. i will always work to achieve the america that i believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades, but inspires generations to come. join me, let's go win the nomination. thank you all and god bless you. it feels great. i've had just an amazing time. we landed in the middle of the night from iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. and i'm seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people. i have an uphill climb and i'm going to climb as high and hard as i can because i want to make my case for the people of new hampshire. as you said, they're people that i feel very close to. they've been good to my husband, to me, my family. but what's most important is the first in the nation primary. it truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of new hampshire.well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. but the goal has to be to prevent the republicans from getting back into the white house and undoing all the progress that has been made under president obama.

and so i — i'm very proud of the campaign that senator sanders and i are running. i mean, we really have focused on issues. we share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them. we bring different experiences. but we are contrasting on issues, compared to the republicans who, i think, are contrasting on insults. and i think it's a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout new hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds. and i said that i'm a progressive who likes to get things done. and i was somewhat amused today that senator sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on twitter and statements by the campaign, barack obama would not be a progressive, joe biden would not be a progressive, jeanne shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great senator paul wellstone would not be a progressive. so i'm not going to let that bother me. i know where i stand. i know who stands with me. i know what i've done. but i don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. and i don't think it's appropriate that, you know, if planned parenthood endorses me or the human rights campaign endorses me, you know, they're thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. that's just not anything we need to do. let's have a good contest of ideas. let's contrast where we stand. and that's what i intend to do for the next couple of days.

but i — well, you know, i don't really know, anderson. i think — here's what i want young people to know. they don't have to be for me, i'm going to be for them. it doesn't really matter.

if they are not supporting me, i will be their president, i will do everything i can to give them the opportunities they deserve.

as i speak with young people across the country in iowa, new hampshire, and elsewhere, i do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of american opportunity. and i understand that. i mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get. but at the same time i'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that lgbt community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. so i'm impressed with them. and i'm going to do everything i can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important. but you've got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. i have a lot experience doing that. i think i can deliver positive change for young people in our country. and i hope to have the chance to win their support. well, that's for sen. sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people. i have a different take on it. i think the progress that we have made, and particularly the democratic party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. so i want to defend the affordable care act. it is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the democratic party going back to harry truman.  the republicans are...  you know, the republicans are determined to repeal it. and they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. sen. sanders and i share the same goal. we want to get to universal health care coverage. before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare, as you remember.  i fought really hard. the insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. i know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests. so when president obama succeeded, i was thrilled. i don't agree with sen. sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again. we're at 90 percent coverage. i'm going to fix what needs to be fixed. we're going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. so we have a difference. and i think that...  ... is the difference. well, i'll tell you what, dave. i do have a litmus test. i have a bunch of litmus tests because i agree with you. the next president could get as many as three appointments. you know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the white house over to the republicans again is because of the supreme court. i'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the voting rights act. i voted for the reauthorization of the voting rights act when i was in the senate. it passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research. supreme court comes along. they substitute their judgment for the congress, signed by george w. bush. that is one of our problems. they have a view that i just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. so they have given way too much power to corporations. they have given citizens united, the biggest gift to the koch brothers, karl rove and all of those folks whose values i don't share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. we have to preserve marriage equality. we have to go further to end discrimination against the lgbt community...  we've got to make sure...  we've got to make sure to preserve roe v. wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.

we've got work to do...  and here's how i think about it, because when i was a senator, i had to vote on supreme court justices. i'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power. if it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. so i have very strong feelings about what i'll be looking for if i am given the honor of appointing somebody to the supreme court.  that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals. but the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. so it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. so here's how i think about it. i want — i want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because i — i believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more... — often. we are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses. so i don't have any easy or glib answer for you. i think i would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings. i know some other countries, the netherlands and others, have a quite open approach. i'd like to know what their experience has been. because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress. and that is a difficult line to draw. so i thank you — i thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we're all going to have to do some thinking about. no, i can't, michael. i mean i — i'd like to be able to say i could, but here's what i can say. i have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. and military force must always be a last resort not a first choice. that is one of the biggest differences between me and the republicans.

i worked very hard as secretary of state to do what i could diplomatically to avoid conflict. that's why i worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place. i did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict. i will do everything i possibly can to avoid sending american troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts. but i can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that i served as president where it very well might be in america's best vital national security interest. so i want to be honest with you. i will do what i can, i will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions. i will not send american combat troops to iraq or syria. that is off the table. that would be a terrible mistake. we will continue to use special forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face. you know, the network of terrorist organizations — not just isis, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from north africa to south asia — pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves. and we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat isis, to end that terrorist threat. so i will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because i know what's at stake. and i know you can understand why there can't be from me anyway a blanket statement. but i want to assure you i will be transparent, i will be open, and i will explain to the american people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners.
you know the first time i heard that yesterday and here's the reasoning, as best i, i understand from listening to the testimony excerpts. that, if we're going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be army rangers, they can compete to be navy seals, they can compete to be infantry officers in the marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military. i, i have to think about whether i think it's necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending. you know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country. the idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that's going to come out. where i want people to register, i want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and i think if — if we had, you know, if we had a system like that i would, i would be very, very pleased about it. i have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the selective service system. so i just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation. oh, i think that's a very fair question. you know, i did make a mistake and i admitted that i made a mistake. and in large measure that mistake really arose from the bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in iraq. the very explicit appeal that president bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. and he made that comment. and the u.n. inspector hans blix said, give us the time, we will find out. give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of wmd. and the bush administration didn't give them the time. and that was a breach of faith, in my view. but you know i gave them the vote, in large measure because i thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion. turned out not to be. and i really regret that that's the way president bush proceeded. that would not be something you would have to worry about with me. if i tell you we're going to do diplomacy, we're going to hang tough, we're going to get answers, that's exactly what we will do. well, sean, i had a lot of practice.  so i could laugh up here, but it's not easy. it is a brutal experience. and when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when i was working on health care. and you know i was just unrecognizable to myself. what talk radio was saying, what republican members of congress and their allies were saying. i was just stunned. i could not understand how they got away with it. and i have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally. and by that i mean this. the very fair question from rebecca. people ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously. there are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you. but don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. and so now that i've been through this for so many years, sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed. they play to keep. they play to destroy. they are constantly doing whatever they can to win. and they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can't otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. so right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super pac to run ads against me. karl rove has you know solicited money from wall street to run ads against me. i view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know i mean what i say and i will do what i say. and i will stand in their way and i will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on america that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. so i know i have to keep defending against them. but i'm the one who has the experience to do that. it's unlike anything you've ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. and now the koch brothers say they're going to spend $750 million to defeat the democratic nominee. i'm still standing, and i will be standing. so don't worry about that.  yes. it's gotten even better funded. you know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in.

and look, these guys play for keeps. they want to control our country. senator sanders and i agree on that completely. they want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. they salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. but make no mistake, they want to destroy unions. they want to go after any economic interests that they don't believe they can control. they want to destroy our balance of power. they want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. i said today in dover, you know, i don't think all of the republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists. they're just doing the bidding of the koch brothers. they're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business. so this is exactly what they are up to. and, yes...  ... it is probably — look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open. you know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve. and they're shopping among the republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding. so just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it. but it's going to take everybody working together.  well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what i just said. and i acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. when you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. and, you know, i testify for 11 hours, there's nothing to benghazi, they don't give it up, they keep coming after it. so i know that i have to really demonstrate as clearly as i can who i am, what i stand for, and what i've always done. i've always been guided by the same values. i have always listened to people. and i've always worked as hard as i could to produce results for people. so when i ran for the senate the first time and i was out there and, you know, people were barraging, i was running first against rudy giuliani and all of that. and i was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who i am, here's what i do, i want to do this with you. and i won. and then since years later when i ran, i got a higher percentage. and then i did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-senator obama. we saw each other very up close and personal. and he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. so all i can do is to just get up every day and work to do what i believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. and i trust the american people. i trust the people of new hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that i will work my heart out for you. and that's what i hope you will understand. another absolutely wonderful question. thank you, rabbi. i think about this a lot. um, i feel very fortunate that i am a person of faith, that i was raised in my church and that i have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, i think it's incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible. this is hard for me. you know, i never thought i'd be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president. i always wanted to be of service. i met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do. i was happy to support him while i worked in the children's defense fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. i never thought i would do this. and so i have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what i want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man i met in rochester who — whose aids medicine is no longer affordable. and that — that can grip me and make me feel like there's something i can do about that. so i'm constantly trying to balance how do i assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the united states not lose track of who i am, what i believe in and what i want to do to serve? i have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. and i don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, ok, universe, here i am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, i can't do it, it's just overwhelming, i have to retreat. it's that balance that i keep to try to find in my life that i want to see back in our country. and it will be something that i continue to talk about with a — you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. i get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that i have a really close personal relationship with. and, you know, it just gets me grounded. he gets up really early to send it to me. so, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. i have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services. so i really appreciate all that incoming. and the final thing i would say, because again, it's not anything i've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows i — i have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years. and so i've had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues. and i read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the jesuit henri nouwen, who i think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns. and i — i read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me. and it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. so regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful. be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. be grateful for your limitations. know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. but at the end, be grateful. practice the discipline of gratitude. and that has helped me enormously well, look, that's just not the case. and i did represent new york, obviously.

there was no doubt that i took on a lot of what was going down on wall street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a consumer financial protection bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in ceo pay. but i honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that i know who looks at what's happening in this campaign sees the same thing. the wall street interests, the money interests, the republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me. so i just find it kind of a strange argument. i happen to agree with sen. sanders. i'm not just going after wall street though. i think that's too narrow a target. i think we need to go after a company like johnson controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in europe. it's a perversion. it should be stopped. i want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know valeant pharmaceuticals, turing pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. so i take seriously the obligation that i would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average american again...  and but i just have to — i have to respectfully say, i think sen. sanders' target is too small, i really do. you know i respect him going after the big banks. i agree with him. no bank is too big to fail. no executive to powerful to jail. but we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in dodd-frank. so let's know the next president has to implement, but doesn't have to achieve that. here's what i want to do. i want to go after all the other culprits. it wasn't just the big banks. it was the insurance company aig. it was the investment bank lehman brothers. it was countrywide mortgage. it was wachovia. there were a lot of bad actors. and if all you do is look over here, i'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. so i've got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests. i just have a wider group that i think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals...  ... insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that i think are undermining our ecoomy. and frankly they are undermining our democracy. this johnson controls thing really infuriates me. we bailed them out. the republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail. they didn't care about the millions of jobs. barack obama and the democratic congress gave them a bailout. it turned out to be a good deal. all of us paid for it. they paid back the treasury. so we didn't lose any money and we saved millions of jobs. and the auto industry just had a great year. johnson controls was one of those begging for the bailout. and now they're not going to pay their taxes? we're going to go right after that. that is absolutely wrong.  and we need to be focused on getting a fix for that.  i didn't. you know when i was secretary of state several times i said you know i think i'm done. and you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. the circumstances, the concerns i had about the republicans taking back the white house, because i think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody. i did not want to see that happen again. i want to defend president obama's accomplishments and the progress we've made. i want to go further. so yes, i was convinced. but you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they've influenced me on. just name one thing. i'm out here every day saying i'm going to shut them down, i'm going after them. i'm going to jail them if they should be jailed. i'm going to break them up. i mean they're not giving me very much money now. i can tell you that much.  fine with me.  i will do a lot, chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described. i want to move it from a schedule i drug to a schedule ii so that we can begin to do more research. the nih and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out. because i want you to know what we know from science. but i also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research. and so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. i support that. i think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy. we should be learning about what works, what doesn't work. different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for. are they right? we don't know. that's why we have got to do the research. i also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you're taking. i want to accelerate this because i have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. we know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana. i just want to make sure it's the right amount and the right kind. that's why i want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. but you said something else which i think is really important. we can't be here in new hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in new hampshire. not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that i meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they've lost their children. i just left a rally in manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, i just lost my son to an overdose. so i have been working with elected officials like senator shaheen, like governor hassan, like governor shumlin of vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? there are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs. there are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people. so we've got to work on law enforcement. we have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin. we have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in new hampshire. we've got to put more money into this. so all of this to me fits together. you deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges. so that's what i would like to do.  well, first of all, tell them i'm glad they're interested in politics, and i really mean that. i want them to be involved. i want them to feel like i felt when i was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time.

i also want them to take a look at my record, what i have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the children's defense fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in south carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the south. i want them to know that i was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people's rights because i believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. and then i hope they will look at what i have accomplished from, you know, starting the children's health insurance program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan republicans when i was first lady. getting healthcare for our national guard. helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. a long list. and the reason i say that is i think it's very important that, as people move toward the primary on tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done. and as i've said and i mean it absolutely, i have the highest respect for senator sanders. but as the "concord monitor" said today in its writing about this, you know, it's, it's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. so i don't want to over promise. we've got too much of that. i want to tell people what i will do. i want to be specific because i do want to — to go back to the question i was asked earlier — recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in america. we need to set big goals again. i am all for that. i have big, ambitious goals. affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. but i also want them to hold me accountable. i want them to say, ok, how's that actually going to happen? what do we have to do to make it? we've got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the senate. nancy pelosi has said, we're not going to revisit healthcare. we're going to stick with the affordable care act. that's exactly where i am. we're going to improve it. because i am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people's lives. i am a progressive who gets results. and i will be a progressive president who gets results. and the final thing i would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women's ambitions. and i'm going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. i hope it splinters completely and, and i hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically. but in their lives, their profession, how they're treated. i hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment. that's what i want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that's what i want for your daughters.

i used to do this in the white house and, you know, i would, i would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and i would go walk. and i would tell the secret service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists. i had the best time, you know. i would, i would end up over on the mall sometimes, walking around. and a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the white house. i'd be happy to. here, why don't you... so, you know, there's nothing i like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve. so i would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in new hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore. you know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don't tell anybody but meet me, you know, there. that's what i, that's what i want to do, and it's what i get the great joy out of. i am so fortunate that i still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life. and they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other. you know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid. and her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life. and she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl. you know you get knocked down. everybody gets knocked down. what matters is whether you get up. and when you get up, what do you do? how do you behave? are you going to be bitter? angry? upset? are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else? and i'm sure that's exactly what she'd be saying now. she'd be encouraging me. she'd be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it's a brutal business being in politics. and people say things about those you love, whether it's your daughter or someone else. so she was very supportive. but you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time. and so i would sit with her and i would say don't listen to that stuff, mom. and she'd say, well i have to know what they're saying about you. and i'd say you know don't put yourself through that. and so that would be what she'd be doing now i think too. yes. well, thank you. well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary. you know i said earlier today some people said well you know sen. sanders is ahead. and i respect that. and so maybe you know i should go onto the next state. and i said absolutely not. new hampshire has been so good to me and my family. and i love campaigning in new hampshire. i love this process. so, you're going to have to put up with me. i'm going to be going around the state, going to as many events as i can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what i am offering. i really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people. to get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that's my goal. i will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn't even yet recovered from the great recession. we're going to stick with the affordable care act. we're going to make it work. we're going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people. and we're going to defend our rights. we're going to defend a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.  we're going to defend planned parenthood. we're going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against lgbt americans. and we're going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have...  ... 33,000 people a year die from gun violence.  so please, join me in this campaign. i hope you will come out and vote for me on tuesday. and i will fight for you every single day in the white house. thank you all very much.
thank you so much. it is wonderful to be here and see so many friends. i've spoken at a lot of aipac conferences in the past, but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here, thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country. i think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause.

you will keep the u.s.-israel relationship going strong. you know, as a senator from new york and secretary of state i've had the privilege of working closely with aipac members to strengthen and deepen america's ties with israel. now, we may not have always agreed on every detail, but we've always shared an unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to israel's future as a secure and democratic homeland for the jewish people.

and your support helped us expand security and intelligence, cooperation, develop the iron dome missile defense system, build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on iran and so much more. since my first visit to israel 35 years ago, i've returned many times and made many friends. i've worked with and learned from some of israel's great leaders, although, i don't think yitzhak rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the white house balcony when he wanted to smoke.

now i'm here as a candidate for president and i know that all of you understand what's at stake in this election. our next president will walk into the oval office next january and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on. the next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every american and the security of our friends around the world.

so we have to get this right. as aipac members, you understand that while the turmoil of the middle east presents enormous challenge and complexity, walking away is not an option.

candidates for president who think the united states can outsource middle east security to dictators or that america no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong. it would be a serious mistake for the united states to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else.

as we gather here, three evolving threats, iran's continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize israel on the world stage are converging to make the u.s.-israel alliance more indispensable than ever.

we have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation. united states and israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.

this is especially true at a time when israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. parents worry about letting their children walk down the street, families live in fear. just a few weeks ago, a young american veteran and west point graduate named taylor force was murdered by a palestinian terrorist near the jaffa port. these attacks must end immediately and palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.

because we understand the threats israel faces, we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts. today, americans and israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations. the first choice is this, are we prepared to take the u.s.-israel alliance to the next level? this relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe. our work together to develop the iron dome saved many israeli lives when hamas rockets began to fly.

i saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012, when i worked with prime minister netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in gaza and if i'm fortunate enough to be elected president, the united states will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in israel's security. and we will never allow israel's adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us.

when we have differences, as any friends do, we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully. we will also be clear that the united states has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful, more stable, more secure middle east and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome. indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, america needs an israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace.

that's why i believe we must take our alliance to the next level. i hope a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet israel's security needs far into the future. that will also send a clear message to israel's enemies that the united states and israel stand together united. it's also why, as president, i will make a firm commitment to ensure israel maintains its qualitative military edge.

the united states should provide israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat. that includes bolstering israeli missile defenses with new systems, like the arrow 3 and david's sling, and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.

one of the first things i'll do in office is invite the israeli prime minister to visit the white house and i will send a delegation from the pentagon and the joint chiefs to israel forearly consultations. let's also expand our collaboration beyond security. together we can build an even more vibrant culture of innovation that tightens the links between silicon valley and israeli tech companies and entrepreneurs.

there is much americans can learn from israel from cybersecurity to energy security to water security and just on an everyday people to people level. and it's especially important to continue fostering relationships between american and israeli young people who may not always remember our shared past. they are the future of our relationship and we have to do more to promote that. many of the young people here today are on the front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as bds.

particularly at a time when anti-semitism is on the rise across the world, especially in europe, we must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine israel and the jewish people.

i've been sounding the alarm for a while now. as i wrote last year to the heads of major american-jewish organizations, we have to be united in fighting back against bds. many of its proponents have demonized israeli scientists and intellectuals, even students. to all the college students who may have encountered this on campus, i hope you stay strong, keep speaking out, don't let anyone silence you, bully you or try to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.

anti-semitism has no place in any civilized society. not in america, not in europe, not anywhere.

now, all of this work defending israel's legitimacy, expanding security and economic ties, taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep, personal commitment to israel's future as a secure, democratic jewish state and to america's responsibilities as a global leader. tonight, you'll hear from candidates with very different visions of american leadership in the region and around the world. you'll get a glimpse of a potential u.s. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them.

for the security of israel and the world, we need america to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order, an america able to block efforts to isolate or attack israel. the alternative is unthinkable.

yes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on monday, pro-israel on tuesday and who knows what on wednesday, because everything's negotiable. well, my friends, israel's security is non-negotiable.

i have sat in israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs. i've listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg, an arm or even a head. that's why i feel so strongly that america can't ever be neutral when it comes to israel's security or survival. we can't be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target theinnocent. some things aren't negotiable and anyone who doesn't understand that has no business being our president.

the second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us, especially iran. for many years, we've all been rightly focused on the existential danger of iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. after all, this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate israel.

that's why i led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force iran to the negotiating table and why i ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program. today, iran's enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, iran's potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating.

i really believe the united states, israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as i laid out in a speech at the brookings institution last year, it's not good enough to trust and verify. our approach must be distrust and verify.

this deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront iran's aggression across the region. we cannot forget that tehran's fingerprints are on every conflict across the middle east from syria to lebanon to yemen. the iranian revolutionary guard corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the golan from which to threaten israel and they continue to fund palestinian terrorists.

in lebanon, hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in israel. tonight, you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about iran, but there's a big difference between talking about holding tehran accountable and actually doing it. our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement.

we must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed. if i'm elected, the leaders of iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the united states will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary.

iranian provocations, like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly, including with more sanctions.

those missiles were stamped with words declaring, and i quote, "israel should be wiped from the pages of history." we know they could reach israel or hit the tens of thousands of american troops stationed in the middle east. this is a serious danger and it demands a serious response.

the united states must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on iran and the revolutionary guard for their sponsorship of terrorism, illegal arms transfers, human rights violations and other illicit behaviors, like cyber-attacks. we should continue to demand the safe return of robert levinson and all american citizens unjustly held in iranian prisons.

and we must work closely with israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from iran to hezbollah. if the arab league can designate all of hezbollah as a terrorist organization, surely it is time for our friends in europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now.

at the same time, america should always stand with those voices inside iran calling for more openness. now look, we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power, but the iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard. they should know that america is not their

enemy, they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to iran.

now, of course, iran is not the only threat we and israel face. the united states and israel also have to stand together against the threat from isis and other radical jihadists. an isis affiliate in the sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in gaza and partners with hamas.

on saturday, a number of israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in istanbul that may well be linked to isis. two of the dead are u.s.-israeli dual nationals. this is a threat that knows no borders. that's why i've laid out a plan to take the fight to isis from the air, on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire. our goal cannot be to contain isis; we must defeat isis.

and here is a third choice, will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? despite many setbacks, i remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee israel's long-term survival as a strong jewish and democratic state.

it may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists, but inaction cannot be an option. israelis deserve a secure homeland for the jewish people. palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated two-state agreement can provide those outcomes.

if we look at the broader, regional context, converging interests between israel and key arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the israeli-palestinian issue. israelis and palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between israel and arabs. i know how hard all of this is. i remember what it took just to convene prime minister netanyahu and president abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that i presided over, but israelis and palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace.

that will only make it harder later. all of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust. like the recent constructive meetings between the israeli and palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between israel and the palestinian authority.

but at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace. terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools.

that poisons the future. everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. now, america has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president, i would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. and let me be clear, i would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the u.n. security council.

there is one more choice that we face together and in some ways, it may be the most important of all, will we as americans and as israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? we are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom, nations built on principles of equality, tolerance and pluralism.

at our best, both israel and america are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values. this is the real foundation of our alliance and i think it's why so many americans feel such a deep emotional connection with israel. i know that i do and it's why we cannot be neutral about israel and israel's future, because in israel's story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination.

there's so many examples. you know, we look at the pride parade in tel aviv, one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance. we see the vigorous, even raucous debate in israeli politics and feel right at home.

and of course, some of us remember a woman, golda meir, leading israel's government decades ago and wonder what's taking us so long here in america.

but we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished. every generation has to renew our values and yes, even fight for them. today, americans and israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies. now, in a democracy, we're going to have differences, but what americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all muslims entering the united states.

now, we've had dark chapters in our history before, we remember the nearly 1,000 jews aboard the st. louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to europe, but america should be better than this and i believe it's our responsibility as citizens to say so. if you see bigotry, oppose it. if you see violence, condemn it. if you see a bully, stand up to him.

on wednesday evening, jews around the world will celebrate the festival of purim and children will learn the story of esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil. it wasn't easy, she had a good life and by speaking out, she risked everything, but as mordecai reminded her, we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what's right.

as elie wiesel said when accepting the nobel peace prize, "neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented." so my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry. together, let's defend the shared values that already make america and israel great.

let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of americans and israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger. we are stronger together and if we face the future side by side, i know for both israel and america our best days are still ahead.

thank you so much.thank you, thank you so much. thank you all very much. thank you. thank you san diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it's not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it's their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. i want to recognize and thank congressman scott peters for being here, thank you very much.

and all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired national guard and reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.

on monday, we observed memorial day – a day that means a great deal to san diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. we honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways – by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.

that's what i want to speak about today – the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.

it's a choice between a fearful america that's less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident america that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.

as secretary of state, senator and first lady, i had the honor of representing america abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. as a candidate for president, there's nothing i take more seriously than our national security. i've offered clear strategies for how to defeat isis, strengthen our alliances, and make sure iran never gets a nuclear weapon. and i'm going to keep america's security at the heart of my campaign.

because as you know so well, americans aren't just electing a president in november. we're choosing our next commander-in-chief – the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.

and like many across our country and around the world, i believe the person the republicans have nominated for president cannot do the job.

donald trump's ideas aren't just different – they are dangerously incoherent. they're not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.

he is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.

this is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because it's not hard to imagine donald trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.

we cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in donald trump's hands. we cannot let him roll the dice with america.

this is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including saudi arabia.

this is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in nato – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.

he believes we can treat the u.s. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.

he has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes.

he says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has – quote – 'a very good brain.'

he also said, 'i know more about isis than the generals do, believe me.' you know what? i don't believe him.

he says climate change is a hoax invented by the chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like john mccain aren't heroes.

he praises dictators like vladimir putin and picks fights with our friends – including the british prime minister, the mayor of london, the german chancellor, the president of mexico and the pope.

he says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the miss universe pageant in russia.

and to top it off, he believes america is weak. an embarrassment. he called our military a disaster. he said we are – and i quote – a 'third-world country.' and he's been saying things like that for decades.

those are the words my friends of someone who doesn't understand america or the world.

and they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. because if you really believe america is weak – with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you don't know america.

and you certainly don't deserve to lead it.

that's why – even if i weren't in this race – i'd be doing everything i could to make sure donald trump never becomes president – because i believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.

unlike him, i have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. i wrestled with the chinese over a climate deal in copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between israel and hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and lgbt people around the world.

and i have, i have sat in the situation room and advised the president on some of the toughest choices he faced.

so i'm not new to this work. and i'm proud to run on my record, because i think the choice before the american people in this election is clear.

i believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made america great. and i believe with all my heart that america is an exceptional country – that we're still, in lincoln's words, the last, best hope of earth. we are not a country that cowers behind walls. we lead with purpose, and we prevail.

and if america doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.

that is not an outcome we can live with.

as i see it, there are some important things our next president must do to secure american leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. these are all areas in which donald trump and i profoundly disagree. and they are all critical to our future.

first, we need to be strong at home.

that means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. we need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. and we need to break down the barriers that hold americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.

compare that with what trump wants to do. his economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – that's trillion with a 't' – $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. he has no ideas on education. no ideas on innovation. he has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.

none of what donald trump is offering will make america stronger at home. and that would make us weaker in the world.

second, we need to stick with our allies.

america's network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. and our allies deliver for us every day.

our armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. and they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.

take the threat posed by north korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the united states.

when i was secretary of state, we worked closely with our allies japan and south korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a north korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. the technology is ours. key parts of it are located on japanese ships. all three countries contributed to it. and this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.

that's the power of allies.

and it's the legacy of american troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.

now moscow and beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. they'd love for us to elect a president who would jeopardize that source of strength. if donald gets his way, they'll be celebrating in the kremlin. we cannot let that happen.

that's why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving nato, or says he'll stay neutral on israel's security.

it's no small thing when he calls mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. we're lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. why would he want to make one of them an enemy?

and it's no small thing when he suggests that america should withdraw our military support for japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between japan and north korea – and i quote – 'if they do, they do. good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.' i wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war.

yes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. i made that point long before donald trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending. the real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. what he says would weaken our country.

third, we need to embrace all the tools of american power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.

diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. it takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game – but it's worth it.

take the nuclear agreement with iran. when president obama took office, iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. some called for military action. but that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another middle eastern conflict.

president obama chose a different path. and i got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. we brought iran to the table. we began talks. and eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for iran to get a nuclear weapon.

now we must enforce that deal vigorously. and as i've said many times before, our approach must be 'distrust and verify.' the world must understand that the united states will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon. in particular, israel's security is non-negotiable. they're our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.

but there is no question that the world and the united states, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. and we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single american soldier in harm's way.

donald trump says we shouldn't have done the deal. we should have walked away. but that would have meant no more global sanctions, and iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. so then what? war? telling the world, good luck, you deal with iran?

of course trump doesn't have answers to those questions. donald trump doesn't know the first thing about iran or its nuclear program. ask him. it'll become very clear, very quickly.

there's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.

but it doesn't work like that in world affairs. just like being interviewed on the same episode of "60 minutes" as putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with putin.

so the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. we all know the tools donald trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – i'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.

but those tools won't do the trick. rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.

he has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. in fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. and that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.

fourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.

countries like russia and china often work against us. beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. that hurts american workers. moscow has taken aggressive military action in ukraine, right on nato's doorstep. now i've gone toe-to-toe with russia and china, and many other different leaders around the world. so i know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.

that's how i could work with russia to conclude the new start treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with china to increase pressure on north korea. it's how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which trump now wants to rip up.

the key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.

donald doesn't see the complexity. he wants to start a trade war with china. and i understand a lot of americans have concerns about our trade agreements – i do too. but a trade war is something very different. we went down that road in the 1930s. it made the great depression longer and more painful. combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it's not hard to see how a trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.

and i have to say, i don't understand donald's bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for america. he praised china for the tiananmen square massacre; he said it showed strength. he said, 'you've got to give kim jong un credit' for taking over north korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. and he said if he were grading vladimir putin as a leader, he'd give him an 'a.'

now, i'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.

i just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who america's real friends are. because it matters. if you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like putin will eat your lunch.

fifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.

as we saw six months ago in san bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. over the past year, i've laid out my plans for defeating isis.

we need to take out their strongholds in iraq and syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for arab and kurdish forces on the ground. we need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end syria's civil war and close iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping isis alive. we need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. we need to win the battle in cyberspace.

and of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.

that – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating isis.

what's trump's? well he won't say. he is literally keeping it a secret. the secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop isis.

just look at the few things he's actually said on the subject.

he's actually said – and i quote –'maybe syria should be a free zone for isis.' oh, okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the middle east.

then he said we should send tens of thousands of american ground troops to the middle east to fight isis.

he also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against isis, which would mean mass civilian casualties.

it's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. so we can't be certain which of these things he would do. but we can be certain that he's capable of doing any or all of them. letting isis run wild. launching a nuclear attack. starting a ground war. these are all distinct possibilities with donald trump in charge.

and through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing muslims and playing right into the hands of isis'. his proposal to ban 1.5 billion muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. it's also a huge propaganda victory for isis. and it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.

a trump presidency would embolden isis. we cannot take that risk.

this isn't reality television – this is actual reality.

and defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. it takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. donald trump lacks all three.

and one more thing. a president has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. our troops give their all. they deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.

i've worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. i've fought for better health care for our national guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our gold star families. we cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in donald trump's hands.

sixth, we need to stay true to our values.

trump says over and over again, 'the world is laughing at us.' he's been saying this for decades, he didn't just start this year.

he bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when ronald reagan was president, saying that america lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. he was wrong then, and he's wrong now – and you've got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in america, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our president.

the truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us. it's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. it's also that americans work harder, dream bigger – and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.

so it really matters that donald trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. it matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. during the raid to kill bin laden, when every second counted, our seals took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. donald trump may not get it, but that's what honor looks like.

and it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. america stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.

what happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our president engages in bigotry?

and by the way, mr. trump – every time you insult american muslims or mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.

donald trump, donald trump could learn something from them.

that brings me to the final point i want to make today – the temperament it takesto be commander-in-chief.

every president faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. that's the job.

a revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do?

making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. it takes a willingness to listen to other people's points of view with a truly open mind. it also takes humility – knowing you don't know everything – because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions.

i remember being in the situation room with president obama, debating the potential bin laden operation. the president's advisors were divided. the intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. the risks of failure were daunting. the stakes were significant for our battle against al qaeda and our relationship with pakistan. most of all, the lives of those brave seals and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.

it was a decision only the president could make. and when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as i've ever seen.

now imagine donald trump sitting in the situation room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the united states. imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. imagine if he had not just his twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but america's entire arsenal.

do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? do we want his finger anywhere near the button?

i have a lot of faith that the american people will make the right decision. this is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. we're all counting on that.

because making donald trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. it would undo so much of the work that republicans and democrats alike have done over many decades to make america stronger and more secure. it would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. and it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.

that's not the america i know and love.

so yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. and we need to do better by american families and american workers – and we will. but don't let anyone tell you that america isn't great. donald trump's got america all wrong. we are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.

there is no challenge we can't meet, no goal we can't achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.

every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. we remember that every memorial day.

this election is a choice between two very different visions of america.

one that's angry, afraid, and based on the idea that america is fundamentally weak and in decline.

the other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that america is great – just like we always have been.

let's resolve that we can be greater still. that is what i believe in my heart.

i went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. and i never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with? ?'the united states of america' emblazoned on the side. that plane – those words – our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. it represents freedom and hope and opportunity.

i love this country and i know you do too. it's been an honor and a privilege toserve america and i'm going to do everything i can to protect our nation, and make sure we don't lose sight of how strong we really are.

thank you all very much.thank you all very, very much! thank you for that amazing welcome!

thank you all for the great convention that we've had.

and chelsea, thank you. i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. thank you for bringing mark into our family and charlotte and aidan into the world.

and bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago ... it is still going strong.

you know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us. and i've even gotten a few words in along the way.

on tuesday night i was so happy to see that my "explainer in chief" is still on the job.

i'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.

to all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week, thank you. what a remarkable week it's been!

we heard the man from hope, bill clinton, and the man of hope, barack obama. america is stronger because of president obama's leadership. and i'm better because of his friendship.

we heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only joe biden.

he spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people as only he can do.

and first lady michelle obama reminded us that our children are watching. and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.

and for those of you out there who are just getting to know tim kaine you will soon understand why the people of virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator. and he will make our whole country proud as our vice president.

and i want to thank bernie sanders.

bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.

you've put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong.

and to all of your supporters here and around the country, i want you to know i've heard you. your cause is our cause.

our country needs your ideas, energy and passion. that is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for america. we wrote it together, now let's go out and make it happen together!

my friends, we've come to philadelphia, the birthplace of our nation, because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. we all know the story, but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.

when representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king.

the revolution hung in the balance, and somehow they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. and by the time they left philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. that's what made it possible to stand up to a king. that took courage, they had courage. our founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.

now america is once again at a moment of reckoning. powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. bonds of trust and respect are fraying. and just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. it truly is up to us. we have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together.

our country's motto is e pluribus unum, out of many we are one. will we stay true to that motto?

well, we heard donald trump's answer last week at his convention. he wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other. he's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. he's taken the republican party a long way, from morning in america to midnight in america.

he wants us to fear the future and fear each other. well, you know, a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: the only thing we have to fear is fear itself!

now, we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. but we are not afraid. we will rise to the challenge just as we always have. we will not build a wall; instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. and we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy.

we will not ban a religion. we will work with all americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.

yet, we know there is a lot to do. too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. there's too much inequality, too little social mobility, too much paralysis in washington.

too many threats at home and abroad. but just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as americans to meet these challenges.

we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.

we have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had.

we have the most powerful military, the most innovative entrepreneurs, the most enduring values, freedom and equality, justice and opportunity, we should be so proud that those words are associated with us.

i have to tell you, as your secretary of state i went to 112 countries. when people hear those words, they hear america!

so don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. we're not. don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. we do. and most of all, don't believe anyone who says i alone can fix it.

yes, those were actually donald trump's words in cleveland. and they should set off alarm bells for all of us. really? i alone can fix it? isn't he forgetting troops on the front lines, police officers and firefighters who run toward danger, doctors and nurses who care for us, teachers who change lives, entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem, mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? he's forgetting every last one of us.

americans don't say "i alone can fix it." we say "we'll fix it together!"

and remember, remember, our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so america would never be a nation where one person had all the power.

240 years later, we still put our faith in each other. look at what happened in dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. police chief david brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. and you know how the community responded? nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.

that's how americans answer when the call for help goes out.

twenty years ago i wrote a book called "it takes a village." and a lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that? this is what i mean. none of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.

america needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. i believe that with all my heart. that's why "stronger together" is not just a lesson from our history, it's not just a slogan for our campaign, it's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build, a country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.

where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. a country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach, where families are strong, communities are safe and, yes, where love trumps hate.

that's the country we're fighting for. that's the future we're working toward. and so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in america's promise that i accept your nomination for president of the united states!

now, sometimes—sometimes—the people at this podium are new to the national stage. as you know, i'm not one of those people. i've been your first lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of new york, then i represented all of you as secretary of state.

but my job titles only tell you what i've done. they don't tell you why. the truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part.

i get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.

so let me tell you. the family i'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. my family were builders of a different kind, builders in the way most american families are. they used whatever tools they had, whatever god gave them and whatever life in america provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids.

my grandfather worked in the same scranton lace mill for 50 years.

because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. and he was right. my dad, hugh, made it to college, he played football at penn state and enlisted in the navy after pearl harbor. when the war was over, he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies. i remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens. he wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had, and he did.

my mother, dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. she ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid. she was saved by the kindness of others. her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share the entire year.

the lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me. no one gets through life alone. we have to look out for each other and lift each other up. and she made sure i learned the words from our methodist faith: do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.

so i went to work for the children's defense fund, going door-to- door in new bedford, massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. she told me how badly she wanted to go to school. it just didn't seem possible in those days. and i couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.

it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. you need both understanding and action.

so we gathered facts, we built a coalition and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. it's a big idea, isn't it? every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.

but how? how do you make an idea like that real? you do it step by step, year by year, sometimes even door by door. my heart just swelled when i saw anastasia somoza representing millions of young people on this stage.

because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. so it's true. i sweat the details of policy, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in flint, michigan, the number of mental health facilities in iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs.

because it's not just a detail if it's your kid, if it's your family. it's a big deal. and it should be a big deal to you president, too.

after the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who have inspired me, people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine, people like ryan moore and lauren manning. they told their stories tuesday night.

i first met ryan as a 7-year old. he was wearing a full-body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because i leaned over to lift him up. children like ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the children's health insurance program that covers 8 million kids in our country.

lauren manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. it was the thought of her and debbie st. john who you saw in the movie and john dolan and joe sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as i could in the senate on behalf of 9/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero.

i was thinking of lauren, debbie and all the others 10 years later in the white house situation room when president obama made the courageous decision that finally brought osama bin laden to justice.

and in this campaign, i've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. and with your help, i will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the white house.

and you heard from republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign. well, i will be a president for democrats, republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. for all americans together!

tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union. the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president!

standing here as my mother's daughter and my daughter's mother, i'm so happy this day has come. i'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. i'm happy for boys and men. because when any barrier falls in america, it clears the way for everyone.

after all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit!

so let's keep going. let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves to have!

but even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead.

let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.

now, i don't think president obama and vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.

our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. nearly 15 million new private sector jobs, 20 million more americans with health insurance, and an auto industry that just had its best year ever.

now, that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo, not by a long shot. we're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.

i've gone around the country talking to working families and i've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. some of you are frustrated, even furious. and you know what? you're right. it's not yet working the way it should. americans are willing to work and work hard, but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them, period.

democrats, we are the party of working people.

but we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help. so tonight i want to tell you how we will empower americans to live better lives.

my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states.

from my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind, from our inner cities to our small towns, from indian country to coal country, from communities ravaged by addiction, to regions hollowed out by plant closures.

and here's what i believe. i believe america thrives when the middle class thrives. i believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.

that's why we need to appoint supreme court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.

and if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united!

i believe american corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. many of them are, but too many aren't. it's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.

and i believe wall street can never, ever be allowed to wreck main street again.

and i believe in science!

i believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying, clean-energy jobs.

i believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.

comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together. and it's the right thing to do.

so whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.

if you believe that companies should share profits, not pad executive bonuses, join us!

if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us!

if you believe that every man, woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care, join us!

if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to china, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home-grown manufacturers, then join us!

if you believe we should expand social security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us!

and yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us!

that's how we're going to make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.

now, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from donald trump at his convention? he spoke for 70-odd minutes—and i do mean odd—and he offered zero solutions. but we already know he doesn't believe these things. no wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. you might have noticed i love talking about mine.

in my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since world war ii. jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business and infrastructure. if we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. and we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.

bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all.

we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.

it's just not right that donald trump can ignore his debts and students and families can't refinance their debts.

and something we don't say often enough, sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.

we will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.

we will give small businesses, like my dad's, a boost, make it easier to get credit. way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. in america, if you can dream it you should be able to build it.

and we will help you balance family and work. and you know what? if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in!

now, here's the other thing.

now, we're not only going to make all of these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. and here's how: wall street, corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.

this is not because we resent success. but when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is. and we are going to follow the money.

and if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back and we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home.

now, i imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good, but how are you going to get it done? how are you going to break through the gridlock in washington?

well, look at my record. i've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. and if you give me the chance, that's exactly what i'll do as president.

but then i also imagine people are thinking out there, but trump, he's a businessman, he must know something about the economy.

well, let's take a closer look, shall we? in atlantic city, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because donald trump refused to pay his bills.

now, remember what the president said last night: don't boo; vote!

but think of this. people who did the work and needed the money, not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. he just stiffed them. and you know that sales pitch he's making to be president, put your faith in him and you'll win big? that's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. then trump walked away and left working people holding the bag.

he also talks a big game about putting america first. well, please explain what part of "america first" leads him to make trump ties in china, not colorado, trump suits in mexico, not michigan, trump furniture in turkey, not ohio, trump picture frames in india, not wisconsin?

donald trump says he wants to make america great again. well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.

you know, anyone—anyone—reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face, from baghdad to kabul to nice and paris and brussels, from san bernardino to orlando. we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.

so it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance, looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home.

keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. i'm proud that we've put a lid on iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.

now we have to enforce it. and we must keep supporting israel's security.

i'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement. now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.

and i'm proud to stand by our allies in nato against any threat they face, including from russia.

i've laid out my strategy for defeating isis. we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground. we will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.

it won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake we will prevail.

now, donald trump, donald trump says, and this is a quote, "i know more about isis than the generals do." no, donald, you don't.

he thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster.

well, i've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the armed services committee, and i know how wrong he is. our military is a national treasure. we entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country...including captain khan and the sons of tim kaine and mike pence, both marines.

so just ask yourself, do you really think donald trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? donald trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. he loses his cool at the slightest provocation, when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he's challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally. imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis.

a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons!

i can't put it any better than jackie kennedy did after the cuban missile crisis. she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men, the ones moved by fear and pride.

america's strength doesn't come from lashing out. it relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power. and that's the kind of commander in chief i pledge to be.

and if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.

i'm not here to repeal the second amendment. i'm not here to take away your guns. i just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.

we will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.

you know, for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. but i ask you, how can we just stand by and do nothing? you heard, you saw family members of people killed by gun violence, on this stage. you heard, you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.

i refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. we have to heal the divides in our country, not just on guns, but on race, immigration and more.

and that starts with listening, listening to each other, trying as best we can to walk in each other's shoes. so let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable!

let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses good-bye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

and we will defend all our rights, civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities.

and we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. you know, for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off donald trump's comments, excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.

they thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says. like when he called women pigs, or said that an american judge couldn't be fair because of his mexican heritage, or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war, like john mccain, a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect.

now, at first, at first, i admit, i couldn't he meant it either. it was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things, could be like that. but here's the sad truth: there is no other donald trump, this is it.

and in the end, it comes down to what donald trump doesn't get: america is great because america is good!

so enough with the bigotry and the bombast. donald trump's not offering real change, he's offering empty promises. and what are we offering? a bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, to get your kids the opportunities they deserve.

the choice is clear, my friends. every generation of americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. none of us ever have or can do it alone. i know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together. but i'm here to tell you tonight progress is possible. i know because i've seen it in the lives of people across america who get knocked down and get right back up.

and i know it from my own life. more than a few times i've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.

like so much else in my life, i got this from my mother, too. she never let me back down from any challenge. when i tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door, go back out there, she said. and she was right.

you have to stand up to bullies. you have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.

we lost our mother a few years ago, but i miss her every day. and i still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right no matter what. that's what we need to do together as a nation.

and though we may not live to see the glory, as the song from the musical "hamilton" goes, let us gladly join the fight, let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. that's why we're here, not just in this hall, but on this earth. the founders showed us that and so have many others since. they were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.

that is the story of america. and we begin a new chapter tonight.

yes, the world is watching what we do. yes, america's destiny is ours to choose. so let's be stronger together, my fellow americans!

let's look to the future with courage and confidence. let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. and when we do, america will be greater than ever!

thank you, and may god bless you and the united states of america!
“thank you. thank you so much. i am so thrilled to be back in reno! thank you.

i have to say though, i know when i’m back here in reno, i’m the other hillary, and i am more than okay with that, because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job. the fact that she herself is a small business woman and really committed to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city, the biggest little city with a great heart, a chance to get ahead and stay ahead. i could not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race, so thank you.

let me also thank dr. karen hilersin and others at truckee meadows community college. i love community colleges and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages, not just young people, a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everyone in america deserves, so thank you.


now i have to begin by saying my original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs. this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes, to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire. i want to be a small business president. my father was a small businessman. and i believe that in america, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.

we’ll be talking a lot more small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead.

but today, here in this community college devoted to opening minds and creating great understanding in this world and the place we live. i want to address something i hear from americans all over our country. everywhere i go, people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election. i understand that concern because it’s like nothing we’ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties.



from the start, donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the republican party. his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.

in just the past week, under the guise of ‘outreach’ to african americans, trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms. ‘poverty. rejection. horrible education. no housing. no homes. no ownership. crime at levels nobody has seen.’ ‘right now,’ he said, ‘you walk down the street and get shot.’ those are his words.


but when i hear them, i think to myself how sad. donald trump misses so much, he doesn’t see. this is a man who clearly doesn’t know about black america and doesn’t care about black america.


donald trump misses so much. he doesn’t see the success of black leaders in every field, the vibrancy of the black-owned businesses, or the strength of the black church. he doesn’t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive. he apparently didn’t see police chief brown on television after the murder of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity.

it really does take a lot of nerve to ask people he’s ignored and mistreated for decades, ‘what do you have to lose?’ because the answer is everything.

now, trump’s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough. but what he’s doing here is more sinister. trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.

it’s a disturbing preview of what kind of president he’d be.

and that’s what i want to make clear today: a man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far, dark reaches of the internet, should never run our government or command our military. ask yourself, if he doesn’t respect all americans, how can he serve all americans?

now, i know that some people still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt. they hope that he will eventually reinvent himself – that there’s a kinder, gentler, more responsible donald trump waiting in the wings somewhere.

because after all, it’s hard to believe anyone – let alone a nominee for president – could really believe all the things he says.

but here’s the hard truth, there is no other donald trump. this is it.

and maya angelou, a great american who i admire very much, she once said: ‘when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’ well, throughout his career and this campaign, donald trump has shown us exactly who he is. and i think we should believe him.

when he was getting his start in business, he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants. their applications would be marked with a ‘c’ – ‘c’ for ‘colored’ – and then rejected. three years later, the justice department took trump back to court because he hadn’t changed.

and the pattern continued through the decades.

state regulators fined one of trump’s casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor. no wonder the turnover rate for his minority employees was way above average.

and let’s not forget that trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so-called ‘birthers.’ he promoted the racist lie that president obama is not really an american citizen – part of a sustained effort to delegitimize america’s first black president.

in 2015, trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie. he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border. none of that is true.

oh, and by the way, by the way, mexico’s not paying for his wall either. if he ever tries to get it built, the american taxpayer will pay for it. we’ll be stuck with the bill.

but there has been a steady stream of bigotry coming from him.

we all remember when trump said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana couldn’t be trusted to do his job because, quote, ‘he’s a mexican.’ think about that. the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican party said a federal judge, who by the way, had a distinguished career, who had to go into hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him, who has mexican heritage but who just like me was born in this country, is somehow incapable solely because of his heritage. even the republican speaker of the house, paul ryan, described that as ‘the textbook definition of a racist comment.’

to this day, trump has never apologized to judge curiel.

but for trump, that is just par for the course.

this is someone who retweets white supremacists online, like the user who goes by the name ‘white-genocide-tm.’ trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people.

his campaign famously posted an anti-semitic image – a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills – that first appeared on white supremacist websites.

the trump campaign has also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in california. and they only dropped him under pressure.

when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke, a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan, trump wouldn’t do it. only later, again under mounting pressure, did he backtrack.

and when trump was asked about anti-semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters, he refused to condemn them.

through it all, he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones.

you remember, he said that thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks. they didn’t.

he suggested that senator ted cruz’s father was involved in the kennedy assassination. perhaps in trump’s mind, because mr. cruz was a cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it. and there is absolutely, of course, no evidence of that.

just recently, trump claimed that president obama founded isis. and then he repeated that over and over again.

his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health. all i can say is, donald, dream on.

but, but my friends— but my friends, this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel. they said in october i’d be dead in six months.

it’s also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones, who claims that 9/11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs. he even said, and this really is just so disgusting, he even said that the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. i don’t know what actually happens in somebody’s mind or how dark their heart must be, to say something like that.

but trump didn’t challenge those lies. he went on jones’ show and said, ‘your reputation is amazing. i will not let you down.’

this from the man who wants to be president of the united states.

i’ve stood by president obama’s side as he made the toughest decisions a commander-in-chief has to make. in times of crisis, our country depends on steady leadership, clear thinking, calm judgment, because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death. i know we have veterans here and i know we have families - mothers and spouses and children of people who are currently serving.

the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who can’t tell the difference, or doesn’t care to, between fact and fiction, and who buys so easily into racially-tinged rumors. someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.

that is yet another reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.

now, i hear and i read some people who are saying that his bluster and bigotry is just overheated campaign rhetoric – an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention. but look at his policies. the ones that trump has proposed, they would put prejudice into practice.

and don’t be distracted by his latest efforts to muddy the waters. he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth, but we know where he stands.

he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country.

he’d abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you’re born in the united states, you’re an american citizen. he says that children born to undocumented parents in america are ‘anchor babies’ and should be deported. millions of them.

he’d ban muslims around the world from entering our country just because of their religion.

think about that for a minute. how would it actually work? people landing in u.s. airports would line up to get their passports stamped, just like they do now. but in trump’s america, when they step up to the counter, the immigration officer would ask every single person, ‘what is your religion?’

and then what? what if someone says, ‘i’m a christian,’ but the agent doesn’t believe him? do they have to prove it? how would they do that?

really, ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock, america has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution, believing in religious freedom and religious liberty. under donald trump, america would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border.

now come to think of it, there actually may be one other place that does that. the so-called islamic state. the territory isis controls. what a cruel irony that someone running for president would equate us with them.

don’t worry, some will say, as president, trump will be surrounded by smart advisors who will rein in his worst impulses.

so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile, maybe cooler heads will convince him not to.

well, maybe.

but look at who he’s put in charge of his campaign.

trump likes to say he only hires the ‘best people.’ but he’s had to fire so many campaign managers it’s like an episode from the apprentice. and the latest shake-up was designed to – quote – ‘let trump be trump.’ so to do that, he hired stephen bannon, the head of a right-wing website, called breitbart.com, as campaign ceo.



now to give you a flavor of his work, here are a few headlines they’ve published. and i’m not making this up.

‘birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.’

‘would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?’

‘gabby giffords: the gun control movement’s human shield’

‘hoist it high and proud: the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage.’

that one came shortly after the charleston massacre, when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides that breitbart and bannon tried to inflame.

just imagine – donald trump reading that and thinking: ‘this is what i need more of in my campaign.’

now bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone. this spring, he railed against speaker paul ryan for, quote ‘rubbing his social-justice catholicism in my nose every second.’ no wonder he’s gone to work for trump – the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope.

it’s truly hard to believe, but according to the southern poverty law center, which tracks hate groups, breitbart embraces ‘ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right.’ this is not conservatism as we have known it, this is not republicanism as we have known it. these are racist ideas. race-baiting ideas. anti-muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women –– all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the ‘alt-right.’

now, alt-right is short for ‘alternative right.’ the wall street journal describes it as a loose, but organized movement, mostly online, that ‘rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity.’

so the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for this group. a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party.

this is part of a broader story — the rising tide of hardline, right-wing nationalism around the world.

just yesterday, one of britain’s most prominent right-wing leaders, a man named, nigel farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have britain leave the european union, campaigned with donald trump in mississippi.

farage has called for the bar of legal immigrants from public school and health services. has said women, and i quote, ‘are worth less than men,’ and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race. that’s who donald trump wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of american voters.

and the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president vladimir putin. in fact, farage regularly appears on russian propaganda programs. now he’s standing on the same stage as the republican nominee. trump himself heaps praise on putin and embraces pro-russian policies. he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies, recognizing russia’s annexation of crimea, giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe. american presidents from truman, to reagan, to bush and clinton, to obama, have rejected the kind of approach trump is taking on russia. and we should, too.

all of this adds up to something we have never seen before. of course, there’s always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, a lot of it rising from racial resentment. but it’s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone. until now.

on david duke’s radio show the other day, the mood was jubilant. ‘we appear to have taken over the republican party,’ one white supremacist said. duke laughed. ‘no, there’s still more work to do,’ he replied.

so no one should have any illusions about what’s really going on here. the names may have changed. racists now call themselves ‘racialists.’ white supremacists now call themselves ‘white nationalists.’ the paranoid fringe now calls itself ‘alt-right.’ but the hate burns just as bright.

and now trump is trying to rebrand himself as well. but don’t be fooled.

there’s an old mexican proverb that says ‘tell me with whom you walk, and i will tell you who you are.’

but we know who trump is. a few words on a teleprompter won’t change that.

he says he wants to ‘make america great again,’ but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be ‘make america hate again.’

and this isn’t just about one election. it’s about who we are as a nation. it’s about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren.

next time you see trump rant on television, think about all the children listening across america. kids hear a lot more than we think.

parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘trump effect.’ they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, muslims, and immigrants. at a recent high school basketball game in indiana, white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of ‘build the wall!’ and ‘speak english.’ after a similar incident in iowa, one frustrated school principal said, ‘they see it in a presidential campaign and now it's ok for everyone to say this.’

we wouldn’t tolerate this kind of behavior before and we wouldn’t tolerate it in our own homes. and we shouldn’t stand for it in a presidential candidate.

my friends, this is a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump. it’s a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that america is better than this.

twenty years ago, when bob dole accepted the republican nomination, he pointed to the exits in the convention hall and told any racists in the party to get out.

the week after 9/11, george w. bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims ‘love america just as much as i do.’

in 2008, john mccain told his own supporters that they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat. senator mccain made sure they knew – barack obama, he said, is an american citizen and ‘a decent person.’

we need that kind of leadership again.

we can have our disagreements, and believe me, i understand that. i think that’s healthy. we need good debates, but we need to do it in a respectful way, not finger pointing and blaming, and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice.

every day, more americans are standing up and saying ‘enough is enough’ – including a lot of republicans. and i am honored to have their support in this campaign.

and i promise you this: with your help, i will be a president for democrats, republicans, and independents. for those who vote for me and for those who vote against me. i will be a president for all americans.

because i truly believe we are stronger together.

this is a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people. the young people in america today are the most open, diverse, and connected generation we have ever seen.

how many of you saw any of the olympics? right? i was so proud, i always get so carried away whenever the olympics are on. and you look at the diversity of our athletes - look at our fabulous olympic team representing the united stated of america. ibtihaj muhammad, an african-american muslim from new jersey, won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill. would she even have a place in donald trump’s america?

and i will tell you, when i was growing up, in so many parts of our country, simone manuel wouldn’t have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as katie ledecky. and now together on our swimming team they’re winning olympic medals as teammates.

i don’t know about you, but i don’t think we have a person to waste. we want to build an america where everyone has a place. where if you work hard and do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead. that’s the basic bargain of america. and we cannot get to where we need to be, unless we move forward together and stand up against prejudice and paranoia. and prove, again, that america is great because america is good.

thank you all so very much, let’s go out and win the election. god bless you and god bless the united states of america.”
